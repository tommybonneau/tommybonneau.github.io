    <h2><u>Déjà Vu</u></h2>

    <h4><em>A Short Fiction Inspired by Military Training</h4></em>

        <p>
        Out of the trench and over the wall,<br>
        I find myself crawling, clinging my body to the ground as <br>
        sounds of machine guns fire and bullets fly overhead<br>
        along with the bass that is mortor rounds impacting nearby. <br><br>

        The vibrations carry through the hands that cling the earth, <br>
        and that of my rifle.<br><br>

        The dark night is only illuminated by that of the tracer rounds <br>
        and raw energy derived from explosives and flames. <br><br>

        I keep pulling my body foward, only seeing my hands in front of me.<br><br>

        My hands, my hands, similar in size and shapes to those who crawl next to me, <br>
        similar to those who fire at me.<br><br>

        But Déjà Vu strikes as I look at my hands, <br>
        as it was only a decade ago, where these were hands of just a child.<br><br>

        They are the same hands, afterall.<br><br>

        It felt like yestrerday.<br><br>

        But tonight, these hands move me and save my life, <br><br>

        so I can that of anothers tomarrow.<br>
        </p>

    <strong>Déjà Vu is a funny thing.</strong>

    <h2><u>Wings</u></h2>

    <h4><em>A Short Fiction Inspired by an Italian Opera</h4></em>

        <p>
        In a flash<br>
        both literally and figuitivly,<br>
        one whom I called brother, <br>
        the type of friend you could spend enternity with<br>
        lie dead in cold blood. <br><br>

        I stand there, <br>
        belived to be untoucnhed,<br>
        in a trance,<br>
        as the blood from his wounds flow,<br>
        flooding the surrounding sidewalk. <br><br>

        The blood is thick, <br>
        crystal,<br>
        reflecting the dim dirty flickering light of the telephone pole directly above.<br><br>

        Brother,<br>
        My brother is bleeding, <br>
        the life of him now stained in concrete.<br><br>

        Time ticks,<br>
        blood leaks, <br>
        and tears fall of my cheek.<br><br>

        And with nobody around to hear my cries of help,<br>
        I stay silent, and fall to my knees, at the feet of brother.<br><br>

        His face, though, reflects peace. <br>
        Contemptment.<br>
        A soft smile resonates from his lips.<br><br>

        Replaced by the waxing cresent moonlight of January <br>
        is the dirty street light as it goes out forever,<br>
        and out is the soul of my brother.<br><br>

        As the moon illuminates him now,<br>
        his pool of blood, branched to the left and right side of his body, <br>
        forms that of glorious wings.<br><br>

        And he becomes now, and forever, my guardian angel.<br>
        To guard myself from vows of revenge and the continuing the world's cycle of hatred.<br>
        </p>

    <strong>Break The Cycle.</strong>

    <h2><u>Fire</u></h2>

        <p>
        For but a moment<br><br>

        ...<br><br>

        Flames flared high, <br>
        and hot?<br><br>

        No, my conscience illuminated a mere visual <br>
        what I can only describe as the center of volcano.<br><br>

        Theres a tint to my vision, <br>
        a filter masking all that I see, <br>
        orange,<br>
        analogous with fire.<br><br>

        The complexiy of my surroundings, <br>
        synomonus with waves of heats, <br>
        oscillating obsessivly.<br><br>

        I'm woozy.<br><br>

        So as if I were to take a single step,<br>
        offbalance,<br>
        into the dream my mind manifested<br>
        my flesh would surly conflagrate, <br>
        and my soul combust.<br><br>

        ...<br><br>

        But as if a blink of the eye <br>
        could extinguish the world,<br>
        perhaps from a tear, <br>
        this alternae world my mind forged,<br>
        rest. <br><br>

        For but a moment...<br>
        </p>

        <strong>Extinguish the flames.</strong>

        <h2><u>Songs</u></h2>

        <p>
        I love music.<br><br>

        The spronos of the birds, <br>
        singing as I walk though the thick forest path. <br><br>

        The alto of the the coyote pack,<br>
        at the peak of it's howl <br>
        in the distince as I lay at night.<br><br> 

        The tenor of the crickets,<br>
        chirping, as I convoy though open fields of straw.<br><br>

        The bass of the swamp frogs, <br>
        peeping a constant chord as I see the sun continues to cease.<br><br>

        The percussion of the startled schools of minnows, <br>
        slapping the water leaving ripples, <br>
        disguisied as sounds of raindrops.<br>
        </p>

    <strong>What's on repeat for you?</strong>

    <h2><u>Art</u></h2>

        <p>
        Today I witnessed technology,<br> 
        that quite literally<br>
        created art. <br><br>

        Today, artifical intelligence can create art <br>
        that will forever be more aesthetically pleasing<br>
        than anything I can create. <br><br>

        But emotion,<br>
        Passion;<br>
        these make art beautiful. <br><br>

        And for that, 
        life forever stays nothing less than, <br><br>

        beautiful.<br>
        </p>

    <strong>What is beautiful to you?</strong>

    <h2><u>War</u></h2>

        <p>
        Both my internal introspective self and external enviroment had elevated my stress throughout the week,<br>
        yet at the same time I feel numb. to it all.<br><br>

        9:54PM<br>
        I am without fatigue mentally or physcially and I am without material conscience; <br>
        my notebook.<br>
        I finished the pages of my last hours before. <br><br>

        I drive to buy one, <br>
        to write my thoughts and become wholly rational again as I. am bothered by something internally. <br>
        It could be a number of things.<br><br>

        10:32PM<br>
        The ashphalt absorbs my headlights entirley, <br>
        illuminating fully only whats in front and dissipating into my peripheral. <br>
        Behind me is nothing but the absence of light. <br>
        Dead decrypted leaves, <br>
        likley fallen months before from the ever-cycling oak trees,<br>
        blows in front of my traveling path. <br>
        I am in no rush. <br>
        I could stay here,<br>
        with my thoughts and simplistic observaions,<br>
        letting the minunites pass, <br>
        detached from the complicated reality of everyday life. <br><br>

        I am in the drivers seat eyes foward,<br>
        though I feel i'm looking at myself from a birds eye view. <br><br>

        An uninvited reflection takes control of the entirety of my consciousness. <br><br>

        I am alive, older yet full of youth, and healthly. <br><br>

        I am still minunites away from home<br>
        with the paper of my new journal awaiting ink inscription, <br>
        though I achived what I'd been seeking as I venture into the dead of night on this vacant dimly lit road;<br><br>

        inner peace.<br><br>

        The stress of my life that seems so trival now retreats, <br>
        though a new batttle inevitably begins tomorrow as I forget this meditation.<br>
        </p>

    <strong>Who am I at war with?</strong>

    <h2><u>Mortality</u></h2>

        <p>
        It was only days before the first of spring, <br>
        and the birds, evidently, were livley on this refreshingly warm day. <br><br>

        As was we, endervering on a hike atop this hill. <br><br>

        We had paid little attention to the beauty that encompassed the journey to the peak, <br>
        apart from the relativly flat aspect of the trip, <br>
        where eyes were free. <br>
        Of course this was due to the rockey hillside which demanded attention whilst climbing, <br>
        unless one wanted to know the taste of gneiss or granite. <br><br>

        But coming to the top, <br>
        and finally having the opportunity to bear the fruits of our labor, <br>
        I peared off into the distince. <br><br>

        Miles of tall red oaks, <br>
        that appear stiff and lifeless. <br><br>

        A sea of death I thought. <br><br>

        Though this of course was not true. <br>
        The oaks, whether or not it was evident, <br>
        were alive and well; they would outlive me, afternall. <br><br>

        The mortality I hold was reminded to me on the downslope, <br>
        watching two vulchers encirle us. They I would certinly would outlive, <br>
        though I know they had wished it not so. They were not, could not, expect me to provide for them. <br><br>

        Maybe it was the elderly dog accompanying us that the scavengers had become keen on. <br><br>

        Maybe in a months time, <br>
        the sea of death would finish its tide, <br>
        and bring about budding, bird songs, and an air of life. <br>
        </p>

    <strong>Death brings about life.</strong>

    <h2><u>Compassion.</u></h2>

        <p>
        Two left turning lanes approach, <br>
        only one of which is filled with vechicles;<br>
        the right one. <br><br>

        The left lane hugged a median. <br>
        A homeless man stood there,<br>
        next to an break in traffic, <br>
        next to spot to which I poitioned my SUV.<br><br>

        I looked at him as I drive up. <br><br>

        His complexion dark, <br>
        scruffy, <br>
        bulky,<br>
        yet he held inviting eyes, <br>
        that looked not at me but into distince. <br>
        He looked cold.<br><br>

        His creased cardboard sign with sharpie read <br>
        "Anything Helps". <br>
        Most, including the sign weilder, <br>
        may assume this means monetary help. <br>
        Though I take it literally, <br>
        and offer what I can,<br>
        wheter it be a gronala bar, <br>
        a bottled water, <br>
        or a simple hello. <br><br>

        Unsusal for me, <br>
        I felt complelled to open my wallet.<br>
        Two bills; <br>
        One worth a single dollar and another worth twenty. <br><br>

        Pinching the dollar, <br>
        I'd observed what I obtained earlier in the week for myself, <br>
        still unsued, unopened, but there if I wanted it. <br>
        But here, I thought this man may need it as I did just years ago. <br><br>

        Rolling down my window, <br>
        his those inviting eyes made contact with mine, <br>
        followed with a contagious smile. <br>
        The front teeth mising made no difference. <br>
        I smiled back, with a few words exchanged. <br><br>

        Out my hand reached,<br>
        holding a book with a bill I placed in between random pages.<br><br>

        A new testament, <br>
        pocket-edition. <br><br>

        His grin widened, <br>
        his voice pitch raised with excitment. <br>
        He had told me he had lost his other bible, <br>
        and that he wished he hadn't as he reads it in his tent at night. <br>
        He had made reference to Him durning our conversation,<br>
        pointing above, <br>
        beliving in the signs He provides. <br><br>

        Moments passed, and I drove away. <br><br>

        I felt a mix of emotions. <br><br>

        Shame, <br>
        I felt for him, <br>
        looking though his eyes, <br>
        at the cars who decided to stay away in the futher lane. <br><br>

        Disipointment, <br>
        for those in the cars, <br>
        being less comfortable next to a man in need, <br>
        than with themelvess for wanting to avoid any interaction, <br>
        even eye contact.<br>
        But those in the cars were no different that I just a few years ago.<br><br>

        Joy, <br>
        which was not derived from the feeling of helping a person in need, <br>
        but from the reflection of his expresion when I offered him a single bill, <br>
        along with text of wisdom. <br><br>

        Curiousity, <br>
        as I questioned myself,<br>
        for not giving the man a $20. <br>
        I did not want to give it to him. <br>
        But why? <br>
        Had I thought I needed it more?<br>
        Had I thought I deserved it more?<br>
        Had I thought I would spend it better?<br><br>

        And why had he been staring off into the distince? <br>
        Was he thinking? <br>
        Dozing? <br>
        Or advoiding eyes of judgement?<br><br>

        While writing this, <br>
        it brought me back to 2019, <br>
        when, admittily, <br>
        I unconsciously patronized a homeless man, whose face and hands I remember today. <br>
        My friend at the time whom walked with me patronized me in return, deservingly. <br>
        She put my actions in perspective. <br>
        I ran into him other times, giving him water, or warm cookies I'd bought for myself. <br><br>

        And from that day on I began treating those less fortunate with the upmost respect. <br>
        </p>

    <strong>Perspective changes the way we treat others.</strong>

    <h2><u>Love</u></h2>

        <p>
        Light;<br>
        Sun of dawn pearing though the horizon, <br>
        path interrupeted by the bare tree limbs of winter. <br><br>

        Warmth;<br>
        Our bodies lay together in the morning,<br>
        her breath hits my cheek as she lay on my chest.<br><br>

        Comfort;<br>
        A wish to distort time, <br>
        to afford us this momment longer. <br><br>

    <h2><u>Martyr</u></h2>

        <p>
        Intense emotion I felt, <br>
        driving on an ordinary brisk day of Feburary,<br>
        listening to the reports of militant invasion between two forgien countries, <br>
        located half the distince of the globe away from me. <br><br>

        Sentiment is no stranger to me listening to the news, <br>
        but todays had an unexpected source. <br>
        It was not sympathy for the citizens of the country hosting unwanted conflict, <br>
        or fury at the stubborn leaderships of the superior yet unwarented offensive force, <br>
        but admiration for the warriors defending their oppressed nation <br>
        for on this day, <br>
        soldiers, <br>
        mortal men and women, <br>
        gave the ultimate sacrifice, <br>
        knowing well the dominant yet unfavorable outcome of the engagement, <br>
        to uphold the dignity of themselves, <br>
        and for their country, <br>
        for the world to bear witness. <br>

    <h2><u>Desensitized to Beauty?</u></h2>

        <p>
        "What was I hearing" <br>
        I asked myself with my eyes shut.<br><br>

        Sounds of something wooshing... constant undistinguishablee noise from afar flooding my ears.<br>
        I would of guessed an interstate highway, a mainroad in the distince, where cars and large trucks were traveling hastly. <br><br>

        Instead, I knew where I was. <br><br>

        No more than a few hundred feet away from the ocean front I stood; a rock formation coming between us and the sight of crashing waves, thus explaining the supression of sound. <br>
        I was hearing the raw intensity of mother nature.<br><br>

        Sadness I felt, thinking how accustomed my ears had become to everything in the world unnatural. <br>
        </p>

    <strong>My senses, had they become desentized to true beauty?</strong>

    <h2><u>Why I Write...My Journey</u></h2>

    <h4><em>This peice is going to be a working reflection. 

        <p>
        I did not want to be a writer, <br>
        in fact I use to hate writing.<br><br>

        I have never been gifted at writing, <br>
        and even reading has never come naturally to me.<br><br>

        Truth is I do not know propper grammer, <br>
        my vocabulary is lacking, <br>
        and I was even put into remedial reading classes years back. <br><br>

        What I do love though, endlessly, is reflection and the art of refining my own consciousness. <br><br>

        I practice this daily, and allocate hours a week to this activity. <br>
        Reflection solves countless problems for me, internal and external,<br>
        allows me to know myself to an incredibly deep level (allowing me to have a high emotinal intelligence overall),<br>
        helps me make decions in life that bring about inner peace through thought out principles, <br>
        etc. etc. etc.<br><br>

        The first I remember seriously reflecting was begining highschool, <br>
        where I would spend hours a week trying to find what I wanted to do with my life, <br>
        and opportunities that were available to me; it's how I found out about the National Guard.<br><br>

        Where writing came into the picture was in Basic Combat Training, where any ounce of free time I had I would write.<br><br>

        These writings came in the form of letters that I would send to my girlfriend at that time for the most part. <br>
        I wrote so much about my reflections durning this time that I would go through entire notebooks, <br>
        writing upwards of 10 pages of reflections a day. <br><br>

        I wrote so much that I would skip showers to have more time to write, <br>
        and I even got my notebook taken by the drill sergent and the platoon in trouble once.<br><br>

        However, when basic training had finished, and I no longer had to communicate with others via letters, I stopped... for years. <br><br>

        The next point reflection and writings came to life were when I wrote the many drafts of my medical school personal statement. <br><br>

        These personal statements I was proud of, and it brought an incredible amount of clearity to my own rationale. <br><br>

        From that point on, I began to write regularly. <br><br>

        And so this leads me to today, where I write constantly, and absolutly love it. <br><br>

        Writing became a way to communite with my own consciousness clearly. <br><br>

        Having spent years writing now in my own way, <br>
        what I have discovered that I love most is poetry,<br>
        as I love formulating my refelctions, experiences, and encounters in this world in a beautiful way in my mind, <br>
        and poetry allows me to do so. <br><br>

        Now I have no formal training in poetry nor have I even bothered to understand what poetry truly is. <br><br>

        To me, anyway, it is writing in phrase that is parallel with my conscience, forgetting things like sentence structure and proper grammer. <br><br>

        I do not care about proper writing ediquite or spelling or anything releated to proper english. <br><br>

        These writings are my mind on paper, and nothing less. <br><br>

        I write for myself and nobody else. <br><br>

        Anyway, thats my journey, <br>
        and I hope I write till I grow old and die, <br>
        because if there is anything I can offer this world, <br>
        I intend it to be timeless reflections that others can read and learn from, <br>
        and to extend an a beautiful new lens to how you view the world. <br>
