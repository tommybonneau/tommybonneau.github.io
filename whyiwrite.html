    <h2><u>Why I Write...My Journey</u></h2>

    <h4><em>This peice is going to be a working reflection. </h4></em>

        <p>
        I did not want to be a writer, <br>
        in fact I use to hate writing.<br><br>

        I have never been gifted at writing, <br>
        and even reading has never come naturally to me.<br><br>

        Truth is I do not know propper grammer, <br>
        my vocabulary is lacking, <br>
        and I was even put into remedial reading classes years back. <br><br>

        What I do love though, endlessly, is reflection and the art of refining my own consciousness. <br><br>

        I practice this daily, and allocate hours a week to this activity. <br>
        Reflection solves countless problems for me, internal and external,<br>
        allows me to know myself to an incredibly deep level (allowing me to have a high emotinal intelligence overall),<br>
        helps me make decions in life that bring about inner peace through thought out principles, <br>
        etc. etc. etc.<br><br>

        The first I remember seriously reflecting was begining highschool, <br>
        where I would spend hours a week trying to find what I wanted to do with my life, <br>
        and opportunities that were available to me; it's how I found out about the National Guard.<br><br>

        Where writing came into the picture was in Basic Combat Training, where any ounce of free time I had I would write.<br><br>

        These writings came in the form of letters that I would send to my girlfriend at that time for the most part. <br>
        I wrote so much about my reflections durning this time that I would go through entire notebooks, <br>
        writing upwards of 10 pages of reflections a day. <br><br>

        I wrote so much that I would skip showers to have more time to write, <br>
        and I even got my notebook taken by the drill sergent and the platoon in trouble once.<br><br>

        However, when basic training had finished, and I no longer had to communicate with others via letters, I stopped... for years. <br><br>

        The next point reflection and writings came to life were when I wrote the many drafts of my medical school personal statement. <br><br>

        These personal statements I was proud of, and it brought an incredible amount of clearity to my own rationale. <br><br>

        From that point on, I began to write regularly. <br><br>

        And so this leads me to today, where I write constantly, and absolutly love it. <br><br>

        Writing became a way to communite with my own consciousness clearly. <br><br>

        Having spent years writing now in my own way, <br>
        what I have discovered that I love most is poetry,<br>
        as I love formulating my refelctions, experiences, and encounters in this world in a beautiful way in my mind, <br>
        and poetry allows me to do so. <br><br>

        Now I have no formal training in poetry nor have I even bothered to understand what poetry truly is. <br><br>

        To me, anyway, it is writing in phrase that is parallel with my conscience, forgetting things like sentence structure and proper grammer. <br><br>

        I do not care about proper writing ediquite or spelling or anything releated to proper english. <br><br>

        These writings are my mind on paper, and nothing less. <br><br>

        I write for myself and nobody else. <br><br>

        Anyway, thats my journey, <br>
        and I hope I write till I grow old and die, <br>
        because if there is anything I can offer this world, <br>
        I intend it to be timeless reflections that others can read and learn from, <br>
        and to extend an a beautiful new lens to how you view the world. <br>
        </p>
