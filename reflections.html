        <h2><u>Innocence</u></h2>

        <h4><em>A short fictional story based on a personal dream</h4></em>

            <p>
                As my knife met it's jugular,<br>
                it had not cared to realized it had been critically struck, <br>
                it's snapping jaw is outmatched by my blade. <br><br>

                Not thinking to coward, <br>
                only a undying wish to kill, <br>
                it trashed and tore at an attempt to strike me still.<br><br>

                I held its jaw away, <br>
                only by gripping the knife in its neck.<br><br>

                It was not until I threw its head up, <br>
                up to the heavens this creature is destined, <br>
                and drew the blade down,<br>
                down to the hell which owners of the hound I condemn, <br>
                did I feel release,<br>
                and the warmth of its blood poured out the cavity I carved. <br><br>

                And with it's dying breath, <br>
                it chose to growl, <br>
                and I silently wept,<br>
                having to the the life away of such a beautiful creature, <br>
                bred and raised not knowing love, <br>
                but only fear and hatred for it's enemy, <br>
                never afford the satisfaction of a simple scratch. <br><br>

                Taking the life of other men, <br>
                men who hold the gift of rational, <br>
                has always been something men of war such as I become used to, <br>
                at least in the heat of battle, <br>
                as they know full well the act of pulling a trigger. <br><br>

                But to take the life of a hound, <br>
                hopeless without the rational, <br>
                helpless without instruction of it's owner, <br>
                and innocent to all acts it commits, <br>
                will never rest with me, <br>
                and I curse those who use innocence to edge their immoral selves superior<br>
                because with each innocent life taken, <br>
                my soul must plunder deeper into the godforsaken place that now captures my conscience…<br>

        <h2><u>Gravitate</u></h2>

            <p>
            I begin traverse at a slow and steady pace,<br><br>

            Through the forest of the Amazon, <br>
            whose bare necessities of life teaches me to not take for granted what is provided to me.

            Through the plains of the Africana Savana, <br>
            whose ferocious wildlife teach me to stay cautious despite a masquerade of beauty.

            Through the sands of the Sahara<br>
            whose scorching sands teaceh me to keep moving. 

            Through the tundra of Siberia,<br>
            whose bone-chilling cold teaches me to come prepared to the obstacles that life inevitably brings.

            Through the mountian tops of the Himalayas, <br>
            whose mountian climb teaches me that I can achive anything I set my mind to. 

            Through the oceans of the Mediterian, <br>
            whose reflecting waters teaches me to look within myself for life's answers.
            
            Through center of the earth and hell I stood above,<br>
            through the stars and heaven I gazed from below, <br>
            through time. <br><br>
            
            and finally my journey resides, <br>
            to rest where my heart lies, <br>
            in the arms of the one I call my love, <br>
            and pulled to place I find peace. <br>

        <h2><u>Endless Mystery</u></h2>

            <p>
                Those who seek the Truth are blind to it.<br>
                Those who find Truth hide from it.<br>
                Those who falsify Truth are fools. <br>
            </p>

        <strong>Truth remains humanities endless mystery. </strong><br><br>






        <h2><u>In Search</u></h2>

        <p>
            As I walk into this library, <br>
            my breath is easily taken from my chest, <br>
            and is replaced by an air of inspiration.<br><br>
  
            I came here for a chance to find the answers to the great questions of life.<br><br>
  
            When I go to check in,<br>
            there are three columns to be filled on the booklet:<br><br>
  
            NAME,<br>
            CHECK IN TIME,<br>
            CHECK OUT TIME.<br><br>
  
            Only the first two are filled out for as many pages as I went back;<br>
            there ought to be hundreds,<br>
            maybe thousands here that checked in just this morning.<br><br>
  
            Afterall, it was no small library,<br>
            as any written work throughout history may be found in this library,<br>
            and it grows indefinitely long,<br>
            as the expansion of space and time itself.<br><br>
  
            I walk through marble encapsulated building, <br>
            and as I drift into great minds of humanity, <br>
            I become lost in the seemingly endless columns and rows of man's written word. <br><br>
  
            There are scholars like myself everywhere, <br>
            shoulder to shoulder,<br>
            here on the same quest,<br>
            all looking for the answers. <br><br>
  
            I have to nudge and grind past others just to move a single pace.<br><br>
  
            The air becomes dense, foggy, still, <br>
            and the color of the world slowly dissipates. <br><br>
  
            All that I smell is that of aged pages. <br><br>
  
            The entire time I have been here I have only seen two walls,<br>
            only the shelves of the written word that were perpendicular to myself as I traveled.<br><br>
  
            I have lost all proprioception of where the exit is.<br><br>
  
            It has been rumored that only those that find the truth may leave,<br>
            or die here.<br><br>
  
            It's been years now for me since I've arrived,<br>
            and I am no closer to the answers, <br>
            the truth. <br><br>
  
            Such different perspectives.<br><br>
  
            Such a variety of conclusions.<br><br>
  
            All along my journey,<br>
            there are men who have stopped traveling throughout the library,<br>
            and preach that they have found the answers,<br>
            and thus the way out of this forsaken library.<br><br>
  
            One scholar says there is but one book to find the answers, <br>
            and he hands it to me. <br><br>
  
            I read it, <br>
            over and over for awhile, <br>
            but alas it brings him no closer to the truth, <br>
            and this false prophet too is lost in the library.<br><br>
             Another scholar had spent his lifetime here in the library, <br>
            absorbing all the he can, <br>
            saying that the only way out is to read it all, <br>
            and then the answers will become clear,<br>
            but alas this progress brings him no closer to the truth,<br>
            and this false prophet too is lost in the library.<br><br>
  
            I will die here I thought,<br>
            as it is futile to look for answers here. <br><br>
  
            A thousand lifetimes may be spent here without the production of any truth.<br>
            and I've been traveling for as long as time has existed.<br><br>
  
            I feel so close yet forever away, <br>
            and each day of study I felt a made a step closer,<br>
            to a objective moving just as fast away from me.<br><br>
  
            I climb the bookshelves and look over the library. <br><br>
  
            The view from atop the shelves is astonishing.<br><br>
  
            It is obvious now from up here, <br>
            that the forever stretching library was indeed not such, <br>
            but rather a circle that us scholars have been falsely following for eternity,<br>
            trapped in our own heads.<br><br>
  
            So I lay,<br>
            lay atop the answers other men have found<br>
            in a failed attempt to make their subpar answers my own. <br><br>
  
            I felt at ease now, <br>
            accepting that I will not achieve what I checked into the library to find. <br><br>
  
            I close my eyes, <br>
            tired of reading, <br>
            tired of searching, <br>
            and I forget the competing ideas that have clouded any glimpse of my own original thought. <br><br>
  
            I fall into a slumber, <br>
            welcoming death.<br><br>
  
            It is only here, <br>
            where I achieved inner peace for the first time since coming here. <br><br>
  
            Accepting death allowed me to feel alive.<br><br>
  
            A breeze flows over me,<br>
            and I let go. <br><br>
  
            He has come, I thought. <br>
  
            And all that I longed for comes to me,<br>
            in a rush of self-revelation.<br><br>
  
            When I open my eyes, <br>
            I am on top of the world.<br>
  
        </p>

        <strong>The Truth. </strong><br><br>







        <h2><u>Walk</u></h2>

        <p>
            I walked, <br>
            walked in a direction reciprocated of modernity. <br><br>

            Walked into a field, <br>
            a forest, <br>
            onto the top of the world, <br>
            to live as I was born to, <br>
            free and unrestrained of the mundanity that previously encapsulated my life. <br>
        </p>

    <strong>Free I walk today, <br>
            in hopes I will see you beside me. </strong><br><br>




        <h2><u>A Story</u></h2>

            <p>
                Before I had an outline for a story, <br><br>

                It was not a unique story, <br>
                or creative, <br>
                and just the same as the easily imaginable narratives<br>
                written time and time again, <br>
                throughout the history of modern civilization. <br><br>

                Works that were all too familiar and comfortable, <br>
                and did not spark too much passion, fear, excitement. <br><br>

                Each chapter of my story easily predictable, <br>
                with the protagonist easily lost in the crowd of other characters. <br><br>

                The story was uneventful, <br>
                and left I, <br>
                the writer, <br>
                curious if it was worth my lifetime to finish it. <br><br>

                Afterall, <br>
                who would ever want to pick up and read such a monotonous tale, <br>
                one a reader could have easily written themselves. <br><br>

                Or would it be better to start with a blank page, <br>
                a page that I would now have the chance to write something magnificent, <br>
                a chronicle so original and ingenious it would become the next story millions in history would decide to read,<br>
                a magnum opus of literature. <br>
            </p>

        <strong>The story is of the life we all choose to create for ourselves.</strong><br><br>










       <h2><u>Call to Nature</u></h2>
 
           <p>
           As we climb the mountain for its picturistic view at its peak, <br>
           we are thankful such natural wonders exist in our world. <br><br>
 
           Though, the mountain does not want us there, <br>
           and it tries to tell us by tripping us along our trek with loose rocks and slippery slopes.<br><br>
 
           Though, the wind does not care for our company, <br>
           as it tries to tell us by blowing us off the peak, and chilling us to the bone until we leave. <br><br>
 
           Though, the wildlife does not want us there, <br>
           as it tries to tell us by falling in the way of our path and covering the path to the top. <br><br>
 
           Yet we pound the mountain, <br>
           cut the wind, <br>
           and disturb the wildlife on my way to the top. <br><br>
 
           We feel called to nature, yet we neglect its call to us; <br>
           </p>
 
        <strong>to be left alone.</strong><br><br>
            





        <h2><u>Déjà Vu</u></h2>
 
        <h4><em>A Short Fiction Inspired by Military Training</h4></em>
     
            <p>
            Out of the trench and over the wall,<br>
            I find myself crawling, clinging my body to the ground as <br>
            sounds of machine guns fire and bullets fly overhead<br>
            along with the bass that is mortar rounds impacting nearby. <br><br>
     
            The vibrations carry through the hands that cling the earth, <br>
            and that of my rifle.<br><br>
     
            The dark night is only illuminated by that of the tracer rounds <br>
            and raw energy derived from explosives and flames. <br><br>
     
            I keep pulling my body forward, only seeing my hands in front of me.<br><br>
     
            My hands, my hands, similar in size and shapes to those who crawl next to me, <br>
            similar to those who fire at me.<br><br>
     
            But Déjà Vu strikes as I look at my hands, <br>
            as it was only a decade ago, where these were hands of just a child.<br><br>
     
            They are the same hands, afterall.<br><br>
     
            It felt like yesterday.<br><br>
     
            But tonight, these hands move me and save my life, <br><br>
     
            so I can that of anothers tomorrow.<br>
            </p>
     
        <strong>Déjà Vu is a funny thing.</strong><br><br>

            In a flash<br>
            both literally and figuratively,<br>

            reflecting the dim dirty flickering light of the telephone pole directly above.<br><br>
 
            Brother,<br>

            And with nobody around to hear my cries of help,<br>
            I stay silent, and fall to my knees, at the feet of brother.<br><br>
 
            His face, though, reflects peace. <br>

            his pool of blood, branched to the left and right side of his body, <br>
            forms that of glorious wings.<br><br>
 
            And he becomes now, and forever, my guardian angel.<br>

            ...<br><br>

            Flames flared high, <br>
            and hot?<br><br>

            No, my conscience illuminated a mere visual <br>
            what I can only describe as the center of volcano.<br><br>

            There's a tint to my vision, <br>
            a filter masking all that I see, <br>
            orange,<br>
            analogous with fire.<br><br>

            The complexity of my surroundings, <br>
            synonymous with waves of heats, <br>
            oscillating obsessively.<br><br>

            I'm woozy.<br><br>

            So as if I were to take a single step,<br>
            off balance,<br>
            into the dream my mind manifested<br>
            my flesh would surly conflagrate, <br>
            and my soul combust.<br><br>

            ...<br><br>

            But as if a blink of the eye <br>
            could extinguish the world,<br>
            perhaps from a tear, <br>
            this alternate world my mind forged,<br>
            rest. <br><br>

            For but a moment...<br>
            </p>

        <strong>Extinguish the flames.</strong><br><br>

            <p>
                I love music.<br><br>
      
                The sopranos of the birds, <br>
                singing as I walk through the thick forest path. <br><br>
      
                The alto of the the coyote pack,<br>
                at the peak of it's howl <br>
                in the distance as I lay at night.<br><br>
      
                The tenor of the crickets,<br>
                chirping, as I convoy through open fields of straw.<br><br>
      
                The bass of the swamp frogs, <br>
                peeping a constant chord as I see the sun continues to cease.<br><br>
      
                The percussion of the startled schools of minnows, <br>
                slapping the water leaving ripples, <br>
                disguised as sounds of raindrops.<br>

        <h2><u>Art</u></h2>

        <p>
            Today I witnessed technology,<br>
            that quite literally<br>
            created art. <br><br>
  
            Today, artificial intelligence can create art <br>
            that will forever be more aesthetically pleasing<br>
            than anything I can create. <br><br>
  
            But emotion,<br>
            Passion;<br>
            these make art beautiful. <br><br>
  
            And for that,
            life forever stays nothing less than, <br><br>
  
            beautiful.<br>
         </p>

        <strong>What is beautiful to you?</strong><br><br>

       <h2><u>War</u></h2>
 
           <p>
           Both my internal introspective self and external environment had elevated my stress throughout the week,<br>
           yet at the same time I feel numb. to it all.<br><br>
 
           9:54PM<br>
           I am without fatigue mentally or physically and I am without material conscience; <br>
           my notebook.<br>
           I finished the pages of my last hours before. <br><br>
 
           I drive to buy one, <br>
           to write my thoughts and become wholly rational again as I. am bothered by something internally. <br>
           It could be a number of things.<br><br>
 
           10:32PM<br>
           The asphalt absorbs my headlights entirely, <br>
           illuminating fully only what's in front and dissipating into my peripheral. <br>
           Behind me is nothing but the absence of light. <br>
           Dead decrypted leaves, <br>
           likely fallen months before from the ever-cycling oak trees,<br>
           blows in front of my traveling path. <br>
           I am in no rush. <br>
           I could stay here,<br>
           with my thoughts and simplistic observations,<br>
           letting the minutes pass, <br>
           detached from the complicated reality of everyday life. <br><br>
 
           I am in the driver's seat eyes forward,<br>
           though I feel I'm looking at myself from a birds eye view. <br><br>
 
           An uninvited reflection takes control of the entirety of my consciousness. <br><br>
 
           I am alive, older yet full of youth, and healthy. <br><br>
 
           I am still minutes away from home<br>
           with the paper of my new journal awaiting ink inscription, <br>
           though I achieved what I'd been seeking as I venture into the dead of night on this vacant dimly lit road;<br><br>
 
           inner peace.<br><br>
 
           The stress of my life that seems so trivial now retreats, <br>
           though a new battle inevitably begins tomorrow as I forget this meditation.<br>
           </p>

        <h2><u>Mortality</u></h2>

        <p>
            It was only days before the first of spring, <br>
            and the birds, evidently, were lively on this refreshingly warm day. <br><br>
  
            As was we, endervering on a hike atop this hill. <br><br>
  
            We had paid little attention to the beauty that encompassed the journey to the peak, <br>
            apart from the relatively flat aspect of the trip, <br>
            where eyes were free. <br>
            Of course this was due to the rocky hillside which demanded attention whilst climbing, <br>
            unless one wanted to know the taste of gneiss or granite. <br><br>
  
            But coming to the top, <br>
            and finally having the opportunity to bear the fruits of our labor, <br>
            I peered off into the distance. <br><br>
  
            Miles of tall red oaks, <br>
            that appear stiff and lifeless. <br><br>
  
            A sea of death I thought. <br><br>
  
            Though this of course was not true. <br>
            The oaks, whether or not it was evident, <br>
            were alive and well; they would outlive me, afternall. <br><br>
  
            The mortality I hold was reminded to me on the downslope, <br>
            watching two vulchers encircle us. They I would certainly would outlive, <br>
            though I know they had wished it not so. They were not, could not, expect me to provide for them. <br><br>
  
            Maybe it was the elderly dog accompanying us that the scavengers had become keen on. <br><br>
  
            Maybe in a months time, <br>
            the sea of death would finish its tide, <br>
            and bring about budding, bird songs, and an air of life. <br>
            </p>

        <h2><u>Compassion.</u></h2>

        <p>
            Two left turning lanes approach, <br>
            only one of which is filled with vehicles;<br>
            the right one. <br><br>
  
            The left lane hugged a median. <br>
            A homeless man stood there,<br>
            next to an break in traffic, <br>
            next to the spot to which I positioned my SUV.<br><br>
  
            I looked at him as I drove up. <br><br>
  
            His complexion dark, <br>
            scruffy, <br>
            bulky,<br>
            yet he held inviting eyes, <br>
            that looked not at me but into distance. <br>
            He looked cold.<br><br>
  
            His creased cardboard sign with sharpie read <br>
            "Anything Helps". <br>
            Most, including the sign wielder, <br>
            may assume this means monetary help. <br>
            Though I take it literally, <br>
            and offer what I can,<br>
            whether it be a granola bar, <br>
            a bottled water, <br>
            or a simple hello. <br><br>
  
            Unusual for me, <br>
            I felt compelled to open my wallet.<br>
            Two bills; <br>
            One worth a single dollar and another worth twenty. <br><br>
  
            Pinching the dollar, <br>
            I'd observed what I obtained earlier in the week for myself, <br>
            still unused, unopened, but there if I wanted it. <br>
            But here, I thought this man may need it as I did just years ago. <br><br>
  
            Rolling down my window, <br>
            his those inviting eyes made contact with mine, <br>
            followed with a contagious smile. <br>
            The missing front teeth made no difference. <br>
            I smiled back, with a few words exchanged. <br><br>
  
            Out my hand reached,<br>
            holding a book with a bill I placed in between random pages.<br><br>
  
            A new testament, <br>
            pocket-edition. <br><br>
  
            His grin widened, <br>
            his voice pitch raised with excitement. <br>
            He had told me he had lost his other bible, <br>
            and that he wished he hadn't as he reads it in his tent at night. <br>
            He had made reference to Him during our conversation,<br>
            pointing above, <br>
            believing in the signs He provides. <br><br>
  
            Moments passed, and I drove away. <br><br>
  
            I felt a mix of emotions. <br><br>
  
            Shame, <br>
            I felt for him, <br>
            looking through his eyes, <br>
            at the cars who decided to stay away in the further lane. <br><br>
  
            Disappointment, <br>
            for those in the cars, <br>
            being less comfortable next to a man in need, <br>
            than with themselves for wanting to avoid any interaction, <br>
            even eye contact.<br>
            But those in the cars were no different that I just a few years ago.<br><br>
  
            Joy, <br>
            which was not derived from the feeling of helping a person in need, <br>
            but from the reflection of his expression when I offered him a single bill, <br>
            along with a text of wisdom. <br><br>
  
            Curiosity, <br>
            as I questioned myself,<br>
            for not giving the man a $20. <br>
            I did not want to give it to him. <br>
            But why? <br>
            Had I thought I needed it more?<br>
            Had I thought I deserved it more?<br>
            Had I thought I would spend it better?<br><br>
  
            And why had he been staring off into the distance? <br>
            Was he thinking? <br>
            Dozing? <br>
            Or avoiding eyes of judgment?<br><br>
  
            While writing this, <br>
            it brought me back to 2019, <br>
            when, admittedly, <br>
            I unconsciously patronized a homeless man, whose face and hands I remember today. <br>
            My friend at the time whom walked with me patronized me in return, deservingly. <br>
            She put my actions in perspective. <br>
            I ran into him other times, giving him water, or warm cookies I'd bought for myself. <br><br>
  
            And from that day on I began treating those less fortunate with the upmost respect. <br>
            </p>

            Sun of dawn peering through the horizon, <br>

        <h2><u>Martyr</u></h2>

            <p>
                Intense emotion I felt, <br>
                driving on an ordinary brisk day of February,<br>
                listening to the reports of militant invasion between two forgien countries, <br>
                located half the distance of the globe away from me. <br><br>
    
                Sentiment is no stranger to me listening to the news, <br>
                but today’s had an unexpected source. <br>
                It was not sympathy for the citizens of the country hosting unwanted conflict, <br>
                or fury at the stubborn leaderships of the superior yet unwarranted offensive force, <br>
                but admiration for the warriors defending their oppressed nation <br>
                for on this day, <br>
                soldiers, <br>
                mortal men and women, <br>
                gave the ultimate sacrifice, <br>
                knowing well the dominant yet unfavorable outcome of the engagement, <br>
                to uphold the dignity of themselves, <br>
                and for their country, <br>
                for the world to bear witness. <br>

             <p>
                "What was I hearing" <br>
                I asked myself with my eyes shut.<br><br>
    
                Sounds of something whooshing... constant indistinguishable noise from afar flooding my ears.<br>
                I would have guessed an interstate highway, a main road in the distance, where cars and large trucks were traveling hastily. <br><br>
    
                Instead, I knew where I was. <br><br>
    
                No more than a few hundred feet away from the ocean front I stood; a rock formation coming between us and the sight of crashing waves, thus explaining the suppression of sound. <br>
                I was hearing the raw intensity of mother nature.<br><br>
    
                Sadness I felt, thinking how accustomed my ears had become to everything in the world unnatural. <br>
