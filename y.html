     <h1><u>ESSAYS</u></h1>
     <div>
     <p> Anybody who spends time aroud me knows that I spend everyday journaling, <br>
      keeping my notebook and pencil by my side. <br><br>

      It brings inner peace to me when I journal, <br>
      as I have too many thoughts <em>(reflections)</em> that I keep within me. <br><br>

      Naturally, as an introvert, <br>
      I keep the majority of these reflections to myself, <br>
      though I do wish to share them. <br><br>

      Sharing our deep introspective reflecttions is, afterall, <br>
      a way we can best flourish with regard to our human nature.<br> <br>

      This creative venture is partly inspired by Marcus Aurelius (Roman Emperorr 161-180), <br>
      who had written a series of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditationspersonal writings">personal writings.</a><br><br>

“He’s back and drunk again,” said another soldier over the radio. <br>

I looked, and ah yes, it clicked. <br>

Jose was back, sitting in a chair outside the cot room and in front of the station, the help desk, so I had no choice but to look at him in all his drunken sorrows. <br>

Jose was here yesterday, and our introduction began with him on the floor, covered in his own blood, after he tripped on a transition strip going into a room we were not even supposed to be in. <br>

He had laid there was three over soldiers try to communicate with him. <br>

He just looked at us passively as we spoke to him, trying to get an assessment of who we were, and why he was on the floor in this room. <br>

“We need a Spanish speaker” was called over the radio. <br>

“I am not drunk” he had said over and over, as translated by the only soldier on shift who spoke spanish. Jose was probably afraid we were going to kick him out of the premises when who knows how far he traveled here to just lay down on a cot. <br>

It was all that he wished to do, and so after we gave jose a tissue to wipe himself free of his own blood, we managed to position him onto a cot, and he went to sleep. <br>

That was my introduction to Jose, and today he was here again. <br>

Five hours went by. <br>

“Hey, Jose soiled himself, can you get him a set of new clothes to change into? I will help him get changed” another guest of the heating station said to me “oh, and of course we don't want him changing outside where the portable toilet tent is, let us use the private bathroom. I can help him because I speak spanish” <br>

His gesture seemed genuine and sincere, but that private bathroom is a bathroom only allowed for handicapped individuals, and for lower enlisted soldiers, such as I.<br>

Another soldier spoke before I, and told him that they could not use the bathroom. <br>

“Okay then, he can change himself”. <br>

I had to convince the other soldier to allow this to happen, given the condition of jose. I am sure that the other soldier also did not want to be left with the job of cleaning and changing jose. <br>

“Alright, I got the okay for you to use the private bathroom”.<br>

“That's what I thought” said jose's “friend” snarky. <br>

But when it came time for us to stand up Jose, he wobbled; his fall awaited him on his next step, if I had let him take it. <br>

“No, he is not ready, he is not able to walk” I said and ensured he sat right back down. <br>

The other guest who was willing to help fought me on this, stating Jose was fine enough to change in the private bathroom. <br>

We agreed we would wait an hour, on top of the already five hours that had gone by with Jose sitting there in his chair in front of my desk. <br>

I realized that Jose had missed breakfast and lunch, and I hadn't seen him take a sip of any water. I brought him food and water, and quite literally had to open the package of food for him as I witnessed him struggle to open it either from being still too drunk, or because his hands were completely covered in sores. <br>

I spoke to him through the little spanish that I did know, telling him to drink and eat, and I kept giving him more and more water. <br>

Only after fifteen minutes of waiting for Jose to sober up, the other guest spoke “Okay Jose, let's get you up and change '' and Jose again wobbled. <br>

“No, he is not getting changed now, he is unstable and he will fall. I appreciate your willingness to help, but I am uncomfortable with him walking right now” I said sternly to the other impatient guest. <br>

And when another soldier had overhead the plan for jose to go in the private bathroom with this individual to change, they said to me “make sure you go with them” implying to not lose sight of jose and the other guest. The other client heard this, and said in an annoyed response “Jose can change himself, this is now your job soldier” and he left.<br>

He did not say anything to Jose. In fact, he never spoke a word of Spanish to Jose, and he was unable to translate what Jose was saying. It was evident that the guest had lied about his ability to speak Spanish.<br>

It became evident to me that there was a probability that this individual wanted to get Jose alone and out of supervision to either rob or rape him. Jose was totally helpless at this point. <br>

The “friend” left, and it was just Jose and I. <br>

He said a word I recognized to be sleep, and so now I decided to forgo the mission to get him changed, and get him onto a cot to sleep; it was going to be the best thing for him now. Afternall, I was unsure Jose had even soiled himself; I had taken the other individual's word but who knows if that was true or just a lie a part of a bigger scheme. Regardless of the truth, I told him to change, or what I thought was “to change later”. He seemed to understand, and he gave his last request to me.<br> 

He signaled for a blanket, and so I retrieved one for Jose and draped it over him. <br>

In return, he look at me and said something in spanish that I was unable to comprehend, until he pointed at me and said <br>

“Jesus”. <br>

A wave of emotion fell over me, and I placed my hand over my heart, speechless at what he just signaled and said. <br>

My shift had ended, and I left Jose there in his cot, having waived goodbye, and I never saw him again. <br>

     <h2><u>Chat gtp makes me sad.</u></h2><div>
     <p>
      It was only a few months ago that I had a reflection about the new A.I. programs that are able to create beautiful aesthetic art given parameters by a person, such as “a child on a rainy day walking down the street”, and it creating just that. Or perhaps you had an actual photograph that you wanted changed to a particular style, i.e. me turned into a noble white knight; it is now possible. <br><br>

      A computer can now create most of what people are looking for almost instantly. <br><br>
      
      This was aesthetic art. Writing, my own personal passion, was protected. <br><br>
      
      At Least a computer couldnt create an original fictional story. <br><br>
      
      Until it did. It’s called Chat gtp and it’s a free resource through OpenAI. <br><br>
      
      For example, I imputed “A long story about a soldier in war but has girl waiting for him back home”, “story about john in a military mission”, and finally “story about mary missing her soldier”<br>
      and in return i got:<br><br>
      
      “Once upon a time, there was a young man named John who lived in a small town in the countryside. John was a kind and gentle soul, but he had always felt a sense of duty to serve his country. When the opportunity presented itself, he enlisted in the army and was sent to fight in a far-off land.<br>
      John was a brave and skilled soldier, and he quickly rose through the ranks. He fought bravely on the front lines, always thinking of his loved ones back home. His sweetheart, Mary, waited for him patiently, sending him letters filled with love and encouragement.<br>
      Despite the dangers of war, John remained determined and focused on his mission. He knew that his efforts were helping to protect his fellow soldiers and the people of his country.<br><br>
      
      John was a soldier in the US Army and had been serving for the past five years. He had seen his fair share of combat and had proven himself to be a capable and skilled soldier.
      One day, John and his unit were tasked with a special mission: to take out a high-ranking enemy leader who had been causing chaos in the region.
      The team spent weeks preparing for the mission, studying maps and practicing various tactics and strategies. Finally, the day of the mission arrived.
      John and his team set out under the cover of darkness, sneaking past enemy lines and making their way to the enemy leader's compound. They encountered some resistance along the way, but John and his team were able to take out the guards and continue on their mission.<br><br>
      Finally, they reached the compound and quickly took out the enemy leader and his guards. Mission accomplished.
      
      As the war dragged on, John began to miss Mary more and more. He longed to return home and marry her, but he knew that he had to see the conflict through to the end.<br><br>
      
      Mary sat at her kitchen table, staring at the photo of John that she had placed in front of her. John was her husband and a soldier in the US Army. He had been deployed overseas for the past six months, and Mary missed him terribly.<br>
      As she looked at the photo, tears welled up in her eyes. She missed John's warm smile and his strong arms wrapped around her. She missed the sound of his laughter and the way he always knew just what to say to make her feel better.<br>
      Mary tried to keep herself busy while John was away. She spent time with her friends and family, took up new hobbies, and even started volunteering at a local animal shelter. But no matter what she did, she couldn't shake the feeling of loneliness and longing for John's presence.<br>
      Every day, Mary counted down the days until John's deployment would end and he would finally come home. She wrote him letters and sent care packages, trying to let him know just how much she missed him and how proud she was of him for his service.<br>
      Finally, the day arrived when John was set to come home. Mary couldn't wait to see him and threw herself into his arms as soon as he walked through the door. They held each other tightly, tears streaming down their faces as they reunited after so many months apart.<br><br>
      
      Finally, after years of fighting, peace was declared and John was able to return home. He was greeted with a hero's welcome and immediately sought out Mary. When he finally saw her, he knew that all of his sacrifices had been worth it.<br>
      They were married in a small ceremony, surrounded by their loved ones. As they stood together, hand in hand, John knew that he had found the strength to survive the war because of Mary's love. He vowed to spend the rest of his life making her happy and cherishing every moment they had together.<br><br>
      And so, John and Mary lived happily ever after, with the memory of their time apart serving as a reminder of the enduring power of love.”<br><br>
      
      As cool as this is, it is also extremely discouraging that this short story may have taken me a few hours to write, but with chat gtp, it took 5 minutes and it is not amazing but not shit either. <br><br>
      
      I could quite literally create an original novel with chat gtp that would be sufficient to be published for grade school publication, especially in combination with the AI that can create illustrations for the story. One week I would likely have something that could be published. <br><br>
      
      Of course, this does not interest me as there is no beauty in the process, something that I believe makes art or literature actually beautiful. <br><br>
      
      Given that an A.I. program can create written works like this now, and given years down the road, being able to create works that are better than anything I could write, I feel disheartened. <br><br>
      
      However, although an A.I. can create decent original fictional stories based on millions of data points found over the internet to manifest what I wish to be written (given my parameters), it can not and never will be able to write particular works. <br><br>
      
      I will never be able to write how I feel. It will never be able to communicate what I think. So although it can write anything, even decent works, it can never replace me. <br><br>
      
      I will not quit. <br><br>
      
      To end, I told chat gtp to write a Story about a boy named tommy who wants to become a writer and change the world but a computer writes better stories than him<br><br>
      
      Here is it’s output:<br><br>
      
      “Here is a story about a boy named Tommy who wants to become a writer and change the world but a computer writes better stories than him:<br>
      Tommy was a bright and ambitious young boy with a passion for writing. He dreamed of one day becoming a famous author, with the power to change the world through the stories he told.<br>
      Every day, Tommy spent hours at his desk, pouring his heart and soul into his writing. He was determined to be the best writer he could be and to make a difference in the world through his words.<br>
      One day, Tommy's teacher introduced the class to a new computer program that was designed to write stories. The program was able to analyze patterns and trends in storytelling and create unique and engaging tales based on that data.<br>
      Tommy was fascinated by the program and decided to give it a try. He entered some basic information about the kind of story he wanted to write and hit "enter."<br>
      To his surprise, the program produced a beautifully written story that was unlike anything he had ever read before. The characters were complex and well-developed, the plot was compelling, and the writing was flawless.<br>
      Tommy couldn't believe it. A computer had written a better story than he had ever been able to write. He felt discouraged and defeated, wondering if he would ever be able to achieve his dream of becoming a successful author.<br>
      But Tommy didn't give up. He knew that writing was a craft that required practice and dedication, and he was determined to improve. He continued to write every day, studying the computer program's stories and learning from them.<br>
      And eventually, Tommy's hard work paid off. He began to write stories that were just as good as those created by the computer program, and he started to build a following of loyal readers.<br>
      Tommy realized that even with the help of technology, writing was still a human art that required heart and passion. And he knew that he had the power to change the world through his words, just as he had always dreamed.”<br><br>

     <h2><u>With Regards to the Nuclear Fussion Breakthrough</u></h2><div>
     <p>
     I thank any whom have dedicated their lives to scientific advancement, whether it be in the field of artificial intelligence, medicine, or in the most relevant field the day I write this, nuclear fusion; a field of study which has potential to completely revolutionize the way in which we live. <br><br>

     With so many problems of the world being derived from the control and use of energy resources and supply chains, both in a geopolitical and environment context, the potential to create a carbon neutral sustainable and reliable source of energy is world changing. <br><br>

     The power of nuclear fusion, or in other words, the power that sun produces, as you can imagine, sounds like something out of a science fiction novel and too wild of an idea to actually be considered a scientific possibility for mankind… well as of this month, december 2022, scientists have made this fantasy possible. <br><br>

     Now, it is inherent that this process may not be commercialized for the use of everyday people such as myself for decades to come, but the fact that this is now possible, means something much greater. <br><br>

     A hope for humanity; that we will not simply burn our fuels and ourselves into extinction. <br><br>

     Let us just hope and pray that the power to hastily invest and promote such a scientific breakthrough surfaces, and any attempt to prevent or slow advances by those whom it would most benefit individually be buried. <br><br>

     Whom I reference as potential killers or hope is the people of earth whom dominate energy distribution… <br><br>

     Hello nuclear fusion and renewable energy… and goodbye fossil fuels. <br><br><br>

     <h2><u>With Regards to the RING Activation</u></h2>
     <div>
     <p>
      Governor, <br><br>
      
      As a representative of the National Guard, 
      I am extremely thankful for the opportunity to be activated in order to support the populations of this state so vulnerable at this time. <br><br>
      
      I joined the Rhode Island National Guard to serve my state and country in times of need, 
      at points when our state or country needs somebody to step up. <br><br>
      
      During COVID, 
      while everyone had to stay home during the initial lockdowns, 
      I was tankful to be able to respond to the emergency that was the first waves of the pandemic. <br><br>
      
      With no doubt that our military capabilities are like none other in the world,
      given the yearly budget both in a actual dollar amount and percent GDP, 
      it is good to see that funding go to use and allow the soldiers who joined for a good cause be able to live by what they believed in when they joined; helping those in need. <br><br>
      
      It saddens me to see the homeless population continue to struggle despite all that has become available to them over the years, but an imperfect state leaves individuals in a situation we hope to not find ourselves; without a home in the elements. <br><br>
      
      Even with all of the organizations, programs, and funding available to combat homelessness, there still go individuals who slip though the cracks given circumstances like they are registered sex offfenders, have a record of arson, face mental health, addiction, or are effected by urban or rural poverty more than others.<br><br>
      
      These populations need more, and again, I am endlessly grateful to be able to serve my state and those in need. <br><br>
      
      Thank you again, 
      and please continue to recognize that you have a militia of willing men and women, 
      ready and eager to help in times of need. <br><br>
      
      I say this as it was just a few weeks ago during elections that your opponent had suggested a solution to a problem you failed to see. <br><br>
      
      RIPTA, a means of public transportation utilized by thousands, especially socio-economically marginalized communities, was found to be short staffed, effectivly leaving people without essential transportation. The focus of this problem's results was children not having transportation to school. <br><br>
      
      Massachuttes just a year ago activated its national guard to drive buses, given the significant shortage of needed school bus drivers. This, as far as I know, proved effective and thus when the problem of children going without proper transportation to school, your political opponent called for you to act and activate the national guard. <br><br>
      
      Your failure to do so had left me wondering if you refused to do so for reasons far better than activating us soldiers, or if you refused to accept your opponents proposition as it would not be favorable for you during election month. <br><br>
      
      But by your activation of the National Guard in this circumstance, <br><br>
      I have more faith in your ability to lead. <br><br>
      
      Thank you. 
    </p>
    <br><br><br>

     <h2><u>With Regards to the Russian Prisoner Swap</u></h2>
     <div>
     <p>
     As much turmoil as there is with regards to allowing Brittany Griner, <br>
     a WNBA caught in a small possession of THC oil, <br>
     being the one freed from Russian imprisonment through the Prisoner Exchange swap over Paul Whalen, <br>
     an American Patriot, <br>
     I have decided that this was an appropriate move on behalf of the United States. <br><br>
     
     At the end of the day, <br>
     the offense of Griner compared to Whalen couldn’t be further apart. <br>
     One charge was the possession of a small amount of THC oil, <br>
     for personal use, <br>
     and widely accepted as a recreational drug in the west. <br>
     The other charge was espionage, <br>
     with possible implications ranging to a national security threat to Russia. <br><br>
     
     Given the fact that both individuals were given a fair and impartial trial, <br>
     and that the truth of the matter is that both Americans were caught committing a crime, <br>
     it is without doubt that I believe Brittany should have been given precedent regardless of her previous feelings or remarks demeaning our country. <br><br>
     
     Yes, <br>
     it would have been far better for the U.S. to get a 2 for 1 deal, <br>
     especially considering the gravity of the crimes U.S. held Russian prisoner, <br>
     Viktor Bout, A.K.A. the merchant of death had against him.<br><br>
     
     For context:<br>
     "Viktor Bout, in my eyes, is one of the most dangerous men on the face of the Earth," <br>
     Michael Braun, the former chief of operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, told "60 Minutes" in 2010.<br><br>
     
     Now on one hand, <br>
     it makes sense on behalf of the U.S. to negotiate for both Russian imprisoned U.S. citizens, <br>
     and on the other hand it makes sense for Russia to only accept a 1 for 1 trade. <br><br>
     
     However, <br>
     who has the true negotiating power here? <br><br>
     
     Russia.<br><br>
     
     Can you hear the cries by millions in Russia for the return of the Merchant of Death like you can for Brittany? <br><br>
     
     Is every celebrity in Russia talking about the unfair imprisonment of Viktor Bout like U.S. celebrities are for Griner (an exaggeration but you can’t escape this sympathy for Griner on U.S. social media)? <br><br>
     
     Does Bout’s imprisonment headline national news week after week since his imprisonment like Griner does here in the U.S.? <br><br>
     
     No, no, no. <br><br>
     
     There was an incredible amount of pressure on the President to bring Griner home, <br>
     who is seen as a victim of having to serve a severe 9 year imprisonment overseas for what would be considered only a misdemeanor in the U.S. <br><br>
     
     It is unmistakable to realize Griner’s return is a priority to the U.S., <br>
     and although many Americans are outraged that she gets to come home and Whalen has to stay, <br>
     a majority of people would be even more outraged to see the opposite; Griner stays and Whalen comes home… <br>
     or even worse… <br>
     to find out Biden had an opportunity to bring Griner home but didn’t. <br><br>
     
     Take the perspective of Russia… <br>
     they bring more to the table for negotiating then the U.S., <br>
     they have more power in this negotiation.<br><br>
     
     It’s obvious we were not going to get a 2 for 1.<br><br>
     
     We took what we could,<br>
     all considered. <br><br>
     
     Paul, by sacrificing your own freedom for that of Brittanys’ whether it was your decision to or not, <br>
     you are still serving and protecting American Citizens. <br><br>
     
     I salute you. 
     
     </p>
     <br><br><br>

     <h2><u>Hope for Haiti</u></h2>
     <div>
     <p>
     To Whom it May Concern:<br><br>
     
     My understanding of the situation in Haiti is that there lies a humanitarian emergency resulting chiefly from the assassination of the democratically appointed president, <br>
     the temporary appointment of the role by a non democratically elected prime minister and therefore a question of legitimacy, <br>
     the uprising of control of the country via gangs who have been committing horrendous crimes in order to show power, <br>
     the outbreak of a once declared eradicate virus cholera, <br>
     and finally a request on behalf of Haiti to the us, the United States of America, to intervene with armed force. <br><br>
     
     
     I do not question the legitimacy or responsibility of my government to understand the gravity of the situation, <br>
     but I do question their inaction. I comprehend the objection to sending United States troops to Haiti durning this time, <br>
     for the reasons of not wishing to risk the lives of American troops, <br>
     the potential expense of such an intervention, <br>
     not not wishing to uphold a current questionable governing authority, <br>
     as well as other more hypothetically based speculations I will not dive into. <br><br>
     
     In fact, I am partly on the same page of the leadership of my country in their apparent plan to work with other countries militaries in order to provide armed support,<br>
     as the U.S. Military is not a world police force. <br><br>
     
     I believe that armed interventiomn from another country will still hold the same level of force necessary to make a considerable difference in Haiti with mitigated risk to the United States, <br>
     and possible other speculative benefits such as incentives to the country that decides to intervene (funding, increased political releations with the U.S. and Haiti, ect).<br><br>
     
     With that being said, what the United States can do, <br>
     is send a handful of United States subject matter experts in the fields relevant to the situation. <br><br>
     
     Not only does the United States hold an enormous amount of military and security related resources, <br>
     we also hold an arsenal of brilliant and pragmatic professionals whom would likely pounce at an opportunity to help the thousands of people driven out of their homes over the last few months, <br>
     stop the rapping and killing of thousands more including children, <br>
     and end the cholera outbreak. <br><br>
     
     Our experts will be able to truly seek what it is that Haiti needs, <br>
     and understand the means to achive the solution pragmnatially.<br><br>
     
     No, Haiti is not our country or curicial ally,<br>
     and what happens to be occurring there is not necessarily in the interest of our own national security excluding the increasing migration of Haitians into the United States, <br>
     however, it is in the interest in the best version of all of us around the world to do what we reasonably as it is not within rational and moral means to turn a blind eye or wholly put the request of support on a less capable entity. <br><br>
     
     No solution will be immediate and complete, <br>
     however, what action on behalf of the United States will provide, even if it is in a non-armed means, is hope to the Haitian people. <br><br>
     
     Hope that families do not have to decide whether between taking their child to seek medical care for cholera or stay home so they do not risk taking fire from the gangs that control the streets. <br><br>
     
     Hope that their homes will not be intruded and they themselves not raped and killed. <br><br>
     
     Hope that action is being taken to help their country, and not having to accept that this is the new way of life. <br>
      </p>

     <h2><u>Judgement</u></h2>
     <div>
      <p>
          Although soldiers, <br>
          among any lower agents of the state,<br>
          may fulfilling a unmoral duty by waging unwarented conflict,<br>
          or commiting an unjust act, <br>
          it is the not the conscious of the individual agent to be judged, <br>
          but that of their leaders. <br><br>

          As agents, <br>
          it is their role to act on behalf of the state. <br><br>

          As agents, <br>
          they do not have enough infomation to make the <em>right</em> decisions, <br>
          but entrust in their informed chain of command to hold this responsbility. <br><br>

          So if acts of the agents,<br>
          ordered by <em>the state</em>, <br>
          are to be seen as inhumane or evil, <br>
          let it not refelct on the leaders.  <br>

          I wish the best for soldiers of both sides of a conflict. <br><br>

          I have a different school of thought for the leaders of the state. <br><br>

          If you are to judge, judge those truly responsible<br>

     <h2><u>Morality</u></h2>
     <div>
               <p>
                  I have made conscious efforts to not act on behalf of my own personal interesst,<br> 
                  or that of the interest of others, <br>
                  but have acted on what I felt was right.<br> <br>
      
                  Though I myself am not <em>currently</em> relegious,<br>
                  i've adopted <em>most</em> of the ethical prinicples writen into scipture, <br>
                  and believe Jesus Christ, in his historical depiction, apart from the diety, <br>
                  is the best role model that I could ever have.<br><br>
      
                  What's moral, however, is not universal. <br>
                  It's been debated for since man had rational. <br><br>
      
                  What we belive is shaped by our teachings, experiences, etc, <br>
                  which is different for everyone.<br><br>
      
                  So, even though I have my own ethical standards I try to keep myself accountable to, <br>
                  It is almost certain that my standards are, atleast in some part, flawed, <br>
                  and my behavior in accordance to these principles even more so. <br><br>
      
                  However, this distortion is what I call the inevitable consequence of human nature.<br><br>
                  
                  Even those amoung us past or present that we belive to be enlightened are likley... <br>
                  False prophets.<br><br>
      
                  As Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi illustrated though his poem, <br>
                  the Elephant in the Dark: <br><br>

                          Some Hindus have an elephant to show.<br>
                          No one here has ever seen an elephant.<br>
                          They bring it at night to a dark room.<br><br>
      
                          One by one, we go in the dark and come out<br>
                          saying how we experience the animal.<br>
                          One of us happens to touch the trunk.<br>
                          A water-pipe kind of creature.<br><br>
      
                          Another, the ear. A very strong, always moving<br>
                          back and forth, fan-animal. Another, the leg.<br>
                          I find it still, like a column on a temple.<br><br>
      
                          Another touches the curved back.<br>
                          A leathery throne. Another the cleverest,<br>
                          feels the tusk. A rounded sword made of porcelain.<br>
                          He is proud of his description.<br><br>
      
                          Each of us touches one place<br>
                          and understands the whole that way.<br>
                          The palm and the fingers feeling in the dark<br>
                          are how the senses explore the reality of the elephant.<br><br>
      
                          If each of us held a candle there,<br>
                          and if we went in together, we could see it.<br>
                         
                   Be respectful <em>and</em> welcoming of other ideologies, opinions, relegions...<br><br>
              
                   Whose to say any amoug us know the <em>truth</em>?<br>

     <h2><u>Why I Write...My Journey</u></h2>
     <div>
      <h4><em>This peice is going to be a working reflection. </h4></em>
        <p>
        I did not want to be a writer, <br>
        in fact I use to hate writing.<br>
        I have never been gifted at writing, <br>
        and even reading has never come naturally to me.<br><br>

        Truth is I do not know propper grammer, <br>
        and I was even put into remedial reading classes years back. <br><br>

        What I do love though, endlessly, is reflection and the art of refining my own consciousness. <br><br>

        I practice this daily, and allocate hours a week to this activity. <br>
        Reflection solves countless problems for me, internal and external,<br>
        allows me to know myself to an incredibly deep level,<br>
        helps me make decions in life that bring about inner peace through thought out principles, <br>
        etc. etc. etc.<br><br>

        The first I remember seriously reflecting was the begining highschool, <br>
        where I would spend hours a week trying to find what I wanted to do with my life, <br>
        and opportunities that were available to me. <br><br>

        Where writing came into the picture was in Basic Combat Training, where any ounce of free time I had I would write.<br>
        It was one of the few luxuries we were allowed.<br><br>

        I wrote so much about my reflections durning this time that I would go through entire notebooks, <br>
        writing upwards of 10 pages of reflections a day, <br>
        skipping showeres at times to finish my thoguhts for the day <br><br>

        I remember how I felt while in basic training, <br>
        and it was as not as you'd expect. <br>
        I was likley the happiest I'd ever been in my adult life, <br>
        and that faded once I finished basic training and stopped writing for a time.<br><br>

        The next point reflection and writings came to life were when I wrote the many drafts of my medical school personal statement. <br><br>

        These personal statements I was proud of, and it brought an incredible amount of clearity to my own rationale, <br>
        and every few months when I had written a new statement, <br>
        it was more representative of who I really was. <br><br>

        From that point on, I began to write regularly. <br><br>

        And so this leads me to today, where I write constantly, and absolutly love it. <br><br>

        Writing became a way to communite with my own consciousness clearly, <br>
        and I belive it will allow me to connect to others in a deeper sense as well.  <br><br>

        Having spent years writing now in my own way, <br>
        what I have discovered that I love most is free writing with a poetic twist,<br>
        formulating my refelctions, experiences, and encounters in this world in a beautiful way.<br><br>

        I do not care about proper writing ediquite or spelling or anything releated to proper english. <br><br>

        These writings are my mind on paper, and nothing less. <br><br>

        I write for myself and nobody else, though I invite others to explore my mind. <br><br>

        Anyway, thats my journey, <br>
        and I hope I write till I grow old and die, <br>
        because if there is anything I can offer this world, <br>
        I intend it to be timeless reflections that others can read and learn from, <br>
        and to extend an a beautiful new lens to how you view the world. <br>

        <p>
        "Hello, I like your pen.<br>
        Today I am at the beach with you. <br>
        You seemed happy today at the Zoo. <br>
        I like to see your inquisite face reading all of the signs and exploring.<br>
        You are so attentive to the animals, espically otters, as they swim by.<br><br>
        
        I think activites like that bring out your inner child, <br>
        observing new beings and learning about them.<br>
        You have a deeper appreaciation for those kinds of things.<br><br>
        
        Today, I also learned something new about you... <br>
        that you feel and experience life and memories so deeply,<br>
        almost like you are re-living the past, <br>
        like when you talked about the sound of the highway and your memories of the Zoo.<br><br>

        I hope we can have more fun days like this...<br><br>

        ...just experiencing life."

     <h2><u>Entend your Lifetime</u></h2>
     <div>
            <h4><em>Awake and Alive</em><h4>
            <p>
            This morning we woke to see break of dawn,<br>
            as I only have a few more days of absolute freedom before I go away for work for a few weeks, <br>
            and start up school shortly after. <br><br>
            
            I've been looking for more hours in my day,<br>
            to make the most of my days left,  <br>
            and so we departed for the coast line for sun up.<br><br>

            The view itself was spectaculatr, <br>
            though most impressive was the extra amount of time I've contributed to my day by waking up early. <br>

            No, I had not contributed a riduclous amount of hours to my day by awaking early, <br>
            though the illusion of having done so was all too real. <br>

            I felt as though those extra hours, having been spent well, gave the impression that I had lived two days in one. <br><br>

            Many times I attempt to wake early, though my half conscious self wishing to sleep succeedes without fail.<br>
            Thoughs of feeling slow and groggy trick my mind into just sleeping in when appropriate, <br>
            regardless of if I've alredy had enough hours to sleep or not... as if I even keep track 99% of the time. <br><br>

            But I loved this morning I dragged myself out of bed to the coast to witness the sun break over the horizon, <br>
            reflecting off the ripples of the seemingly endless sea. <br><br>

            The reflection I had was do not let your subconscious play tricks on you. <br><br>

            You will be happier awake, making the most of life. <br><br>

            Some quick math (sorry):<br>
                I am 22 years old.<br>
                Life expectancy for a U.S. male is approximatly 79 years old. <br><br>

                I have 57 years till my expected death.<br><br>

                With 57 years, 365 days, and waking 1 hour eariler each day (on average),<br>
                that equivaltes tto 20,805 hours added to my conscious life. <br><br>

                If I am conscious 17 hours a day (7 hours asleep), <br>
                then this extra time will equate to about 40 months worth of conscious life.<br><br>
                
            Theres my answer on how to live longer. <br><br>

            Who needs longer telomeres when you can just wake up earlier!<br><br>

            I suppose you could also argue staying up later may work for some, but just not for me.<br><br>

            I enjoy daylight hours more than nightime. <br><br>

            Carpe Diem.

                    that quite literally<br>
                    created art. <br><br>
    
                    Today, 
                    artifical intelligence can create art <br>
                    that will forever be more aesthetically pleasing<br>
                    than anything I can create. <br><br>

                    these make art beautiful. <br><br>

                        To ask myself who, what, why is important, <br>
                        and not only learn, <br>
                        but critically refect on what infomation I recieve. <br><br>
        
                        What concepts, ideas, solutions come to mind? <br><br>
        
                        I belive books, education, and conversations are a great way to stimulate the mind, <br>
                        but reflection is taking these stimulates and asking more from them. <br><br>
        
                        Knowing facts is simmply not enough, nor should it even be valued in a age of techonoly. <br>
                        Hence is why examinations that test factual knowlahe commit a diservice to students. <br><br>
        
                        What a truly intellectual person does is intake infomationm for the sake of solving problems, <br>
                        whether it be for themselves, <br>
                        of for others, if society is lucky enough to have shaped a mind that wishes to truly benefit the public interest. <br><br>

        <h4><em>What keeps me sane.</em></h4>
        <p>
           Today is day two of many in the field. <br>
           I hold inner peace, though I know I will be away from my loved ones for a few weeks and put to hard work & out of my comfort zone.<br><br>

           I am at peace, and bring no dispair to the field, as I had plenty fun before I had to leave. <br><br>

           The truth is that because I knew I was leaving, with only a little summer left when I return home, I knew I had to enjoy myself the last few days I had freedom before the field.<br><br>

           The last few days I put aside my work, and made it my cheif priority to enjoy myself, and what fun I had in a few days was suprising and fulfilling.<br><br>

           This included:<br>
            going to get sushi x 2,<br>
            going to get mexican drinks x 2<br>
            going to the beach for sunset durning high tide x 2 <br>
            getting morning coffee x 2<br>
            having deep and meaningful conversations <br>
            making love, <br>
            watching the sunrise x 2 (early!)<br>
            and one of my favorites... going to the zoo. <br><br>

           Each of these experiences was incredibly meaningful to me, <br>
           as these are the times I will hold in the back of my head as I endure what encompasses the field life.<br>

               "Thanks for hanging around for me, <br>
               I knkw it must be boring for you."<br><br>

               "No, I am here in my own interet."<br><br>

               "That's what I want to hear,<br>
               <em>you will be rewarded in heaven.</em><br><br>

               Though the statement holds no meaning to me objectivly, <br>
               on account of my non-relegious beleifs, <br>
               the words were powerful enough to bring a tear to my eye, <br>
               and bring my voice to soft "thank you". <br><br>

               Heaven, <br>
               even if I were believer, <br>
               is still a ways away from me.<br><br>

               But to my elderly, ill, Christian, grandmother, <br>
               saying thosse words hold much more weight, <br>
               as judgement at the gates may just be a breath away. <br><br>

                   Though I, in the past few years, have felt strongly about the pusuit of helping othes day-to-day<br>
                   whilst in the pursut of a greater good,<br>
                   I latley have been feeling as though,<br>
                   at this point in my life atleast,<br>
                   volunteering at any position is not the best means to serve others in my life. <br><br>
       
                   Instead, I have felt a calling to filling my spare time in pursuits such as reading and writing. <br><br>
       
                   Though they may not serve others at this moment, <br>
                   I feel as though I am building a foundation for greater things. <br><br>
       
                   At a age of 22, I feel as though this, above all things, is a necessity to make my lifes impact. <br><br>
       
                   However, this priority is only temporary. <br>
                   I will at some point decide to move focus onto executiing my mission, <br>
                   opposed to builidng up my character and intellect, <br>
                   otherwise the foundation is worthless. <br><br>
       
                   Maybe after twenty-five, fifty, one-hundred books read, <br>
                   after one, three, five years writing, <br>
                   after years of working, traveling to the cornes of the earth, <br>
                   may I have any thoughts remotly worth something twords the world, <br>
                   or words worth sharing to help mankind. <br><br>
       
                   Or shall we hold the belief that anybody can transcend civilization? <br><br>
       
                   Although this may be true, I do not belive it so for me. <br><br>
       
                   I need to educate myself, <br>
                   to a level not achived my most, <br>
                   and use it in the most substantial way, <br>
                   in the <em>right</em> way.<br>
       
                   <strong>What do <em>you</em> know?</strong>
      </p>
      <br><br><br>
     </div>

     <h2><u>Wants & Needs</u></h2>
     <div>
        <h4><em>What is truly necessary?</em></h4>
        <p>
            I consciously attempt to not be materialistic, <br>
            and I would say I am for sure not as materialistic as most.<br><br>

            However, I still catch myself wanting particular items with reasoining rooted in superfical things,<br>
            such as particular items of clothing.<br><br>

            One facet of this materalistic side is where I want to live, and this is much mmore significant than the types of shoes I like to wear.<br><br>
            
            I imagine that I would enjoy a nice older house, on a large piece of property moderetly isolated, <br>
            and close to the shore. <br><br>

            For example, there are some beautiful estates in jamestown that fit this profile. <br><br>

            I imagine living on this estate with my wife and kids, with other family members, pets, and farm animals (i.e. horses, chickens, maybe a cow or two).<br><br>

            This imagination, however, is purly a want and nowhere near a need.<br><br>

            I wish to be very sucessful in my life yet still live a simple life; <br>
            nothing more extravagant than someone of middle class. <br><br>

            This is not becuase I would not enjoy all the luxuries of the wealthy life,<br>
            but becuase I wish to truly be happy and hold inner peace with just the necessities.<br><br>

            I wish to be a leader in my community, <br>
            and many times, the best leaders are not those who receive the best treatment,<br>
            and take advantage of this position in the herirchey,<br>
            but lift those under them. <br><br>

            The money spent on such a beautiful luxurious estate would be better utilized in a foundation, <br>
            or using the estate for purposes other than just that of residence. <br><br>

            Imagine the world where people put there money into things that actually mattered in the world and could let go of such things such as "the american dream"<br>
            which is likley the root of so much inequality in our world. <br><br>

            I do not want to play into that in the slightest.<br><br>

            I do not want to just puruse this ideology to be a better leader in the world, <br>
            but also to truly live with the philosophy "Money does not buy happiness".<br><br>

            I went to a mass at a chrstian non-denominal church for a freind of mine, and this came into light.<br>

            The pastor referenced materialistic wants, and stated that it was completly okay to want and own such items, <br>
            but to never let them control you, and always be able to give them up at once. This was his enlightted interperation of the scriptire that says to let go of all worldly possessions.<br><br>

            His messege was inspiring, not necessiarly in the message he was portrying, but the tone and passion behind his words; <br>
            it was evident that people would follow what he said based upon this.<br><br>

            The pastors message was, to me, seeming to fit what most people want to hear; you can still be morally just and worthy of the kingdom of God, as long as you do not let these earthly possessions control you.<br><br>

            Afterall, how many Christians would there be if scipture was taken just as it is written. How many of the 2.38 billion people would sell their possessions and give to the poor if they took Luke. 12:33-34 literal ..."Sell your possessions and give to the needy. Provide yourselfs with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavers that does not fail, where no theif approaches and no motth destroys. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also".<br><br>

            Yeah, not 2.38 billion. <br><br>
            
            It appears, and this is just from my observations, that the scripture evolves overtime to fit with the majority.. take gay marrige for example ("Who am I to judge?") or divorece.<br><br>

            A friend of mine talked about this extensivly over coffee one day. He had been reading a book that, at on point, compared relegion to epidemology.<br>
            The relegious interpertations that fit the time survive and those dated interperations die... it's how the relegious following continues to be popular. <br><br>

            This makes sense. 

            But I hold a personal philosophy that differs from that of the Bible, that of that pastor, that of the American Dream. <br><br>

            To me, it is rational to have what earthly posessions are necessary to make an impact in the world, sustain yourself, and your loved ones.<br><br>

            For example, average household income in Rhode Island is just under 100,000. <br><br>

            If I were to strictly live to my philosophy, I would achive a household income of just that, and the rest I would dedicate to say, a foundation or other chartible/social purposes...becuase dont get me wrong I would love to make millions... but allocate it to where it matters... not into my estate, yacht, plane, car, watch, etc. <br><br>

            I certinly want many of those things, but I belive I will be far happier in life coming to peace NOT having them than actually having them. 

            I will aim to be content with no more than the average household income.

            To me, this seems most rational for myself and a nobel pursuit. No, I could not give up all posessions, nor would I expect anybody else too.<br><br>

            To be more specific, my intent is to have enough money invested where I make the median household income via dividends (via socially responsible companies) and interest payments or rent payment (via affordable housing).<br><br>

            This buys what is most valvuable... time... time that I can use to serve others... not to indulge in a luxurious life. <br><br>

            Time with combination with being smart with a yearly 100,000 household income should be plenty enough to live a great life. <br><br>

            This ideology has already influnced life decisions of mine. <br><br>

            I had/have the opportunity to go to medical school and become a doctor, with potentiol to land myself with the highest paying salary jobs in the U.S.<br><br>

            This is not what I want to pursue in life, what I had decided on to do for a <em>career</em> will make far less than that, but with monetary not a major priority, or atleast not as high of a priority as other factors, I have choose a career path worth my life time. <br><br>

            Still, it is inevitable that I meet people all the time that value high paying jobs thinking that is the key to a better life, by their defintion anyway.<br><br>

            I hope I have the strength to follow this goal, have peace with what is affordable for an average household, and never let greed bleed into my needs. <br><br>

            I do not need a beautiful ocean front esate.<br><br>

            I need to be a leader, at the front of changing the cutural norm associted with the <em>American Dream</em>.<br><br>

            However, it is entirly possible my way may be corrupted by external factors that I will not dig into on this thread.

      <p> 
        Unsurprisingly, the Taliban has decided to go back on their word that all girls would be allowed to go to school, as they had been able to for 20 years prior to the Taliban regaining control in afghanistan. <br><br>

        Afterall, it was only 20 years ago since the Taliban previously reigned in Afganistan and barred girls from attending school before, murdering those, including children, who opposed their ideology. <br><br>
        
        However, this time around, they had only banned girls at the 6th grade level and on.<br><br>
        
        There was no cancelation announcement for secondary school girls attempting to attend classes on the scheduled opening day. Instead, they arrived at class, yet were turned away, some with the wave of a hand, others with a wave of a 7.62mm caliber AK-47 assult rifle. <br><br>
        
        The Taliban's ambassador the the United Nations gave a statement regarding that this barring of girls from attending secondary education was only temporary, stating it was only a matter of a uniform issue to be resolved soon. This statement, however, I have no confidence in. An organization whose ranks are filled with a variety of extremists will not follow along with a spokesperson's promises; a puppet who was likely picked and trained to tailor towards western minds. <br><br>
        
        They also allow women to attend Universities; Taliban controlled universities that is. Taliban controlled curriculum, dress code, classroom policies (i.e. segregation of men and women), and Taliban approved instructors. <br><br>
        
        So they have barred girls from receiving a secondary education and make it unbearable for women to go to university. Assuming the requirements for university is having a secondary education, and the barring of girls from attending 6th grade on, it will only be a matter of time till there are no more girls being education past 12 years old. <br><br>

        I would argue the Taliban is strategizing to get what they want while walking on eggshells to not outrage the western world as much as it had done in the past, allowing them to get away with their oppressive methods. <br>

        Thankfully, it appears girls and women still have access to education though books and the internet. <br><br>

        To the girls and women of Afghanistan, do not give up hope. <br><br>

        Russia recently initiated a war with Ukraine over geopolitical disputes. Like Winston in the Ministry of Truth, who had to spread false information, Russia’s government controlled news stations and papers are forbidden from referring to the war as anything but “a special military operation”. If they don’t? A potential 15 year prison sentence for spreading fake news. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        The Russian President also preached to its citizens that the war is just on account that the “special military operation” is for the “denazification” of Ukraine. Russians including the soldiers are true believers of this, even though the President of Ukraine is, afterall, Jewish and the Ukraine people prideful in their countries leadership (evident from the countless civilians turned combatants laying down their lives in the name of Ukraine).</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        Even when provided with evidence of war and civilian focused attacks, even with Ukarinians calling their Russian families crying out about the war, the Russian people still mistrust the proof, due to the propaganda fed by the Russian controlled news channels.<br></p>
