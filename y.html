    <h1><u>ESSAYS</u></h1>

    <p> Anybody who spends time aroud me knows that I spend everyday journaling, <br>
      keeping my notebook and pencil by my side. <br><br>

      It brings inner peace to me when I journal, <br>
      as I have too many thoughts <em>(reflections)</em> that I keep within me. <br><br>

      Naturally, as an introvert, <br>
      I keep the majority of these reflections to myself, <br>
      though I do wish to share them. <br><br>

      Sharing our deep introspective reflecttions is, afterall, <br>
      a way we can best flourish with regard to our human nature.<br> <br>

      This creative venture is partly inspired by Marcus Aurelius (Roman Emperorr 161-180), <br>
      who had written a series of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditationspersonal writings">personal writings.</a><br><br>
       </p>

    <h2><u>Connection</u></h2>
    <p>
      
      
      It hasn’t been until recently months, <br>
      
      When I find myself continuously in the same routine that I’d followed for the last few years, <br>
      
      That I have felt a deep rooted sense of discomfort. <br><br>
      
      
      To be be walking in the same shoes that I’d walked in for years, <br>
      
      with safety and stability,<br>
      
      only to be suddenly caught off guard by disconnect from what previously served as the foundation of my life?<br><br>
      
      
      It has been messing with my inner peace.<br><br>
      
      
      What’s alleviated this growing feeling of dissociation of what I believe to be the great adventure of life has been escaping into other worlds:<br>
      
      The natural world,<br>
      
      one of my own consciousness, <br>
      
      and the authentic perspective of others who can see the world in such a different and beautiful way that I do. <br><br>
      
      
      Worlds that I will forever be able to explore and learn form, <br>
      
      worlds that provide truth, <br>
      
      so the adventure of life never ends, <br>
      
      and all that is required is a connection.<br><br>
      
    </p>
      <br><br><br>

    <h2><u>Why I Write...My Journey</u></h2>

    <h4><em>This peice is going to be a working reflection. </h4></em>
        <p>
        I did not want to be a writer, <br>
        in fact I use to hate writing.<br>
        I have never been gifted at writing, <br>
        and even reading has never come naturally to me.<br><br>

        Truth is I do not know propper grammer, <br>
        and I was even put into remedial reading classes years back. <br><br>

        What I do love though, endlessly, is reflection and the art of refining my own consciousness. <br><br>

        I practice this daily, and allocate hours a week to this activity. <br>
        Reflection solves countless problems for me, internal and external,<br>
        allows me to know myself to an incredibly deep level,<br>
        helps me make decions in life that bring about inner peace through thought out principles, <br>
        etc. etc. etc.<br><br>

        The first I remember seriously reflecting was the begining highschool, <br>
        where I would spend hours a week trying to find what I wanted to do with my life, <br>
        and opportunities that were available to me. <br><br>

        Where writing came into the picture was in Basic Combat Training, where any ounce of free time I had I would write.<br>
        It was one of the few luxuries we were allowed.<br><br>

        I wrote so much about my reflections durning this time that I would go through entire notebooks, <br>
        writing upwards of 10 pages of reflections a day, <br>
        skipping showeres at times to finish my thoguhts for the day <br><br>

        I remember how I felt while in basic training, <br>
        and it was as not as you'd expect. <br>
        I was likley the happiest I'd ever been in my adult life, <br>
        and that faded once I finished basic training and stopped writing for a time.<br><br>

        The next point reflection and writings came to life were when I wrote the many drafts of my medical school personal statement. <br><br>

        These personal statements I was proud of, and it brought an incredible amount of clearity to my own rationale, <br>
        and every few months when I had written a new statement, <br>
        it was more representative of who I really was. <br><br>

        From that point on, I began to write regularly. <br><br>

        And so this leads me to today, where I write constantly, and absolutly love it. <br><br>

        Writing became a way to communite with my own consciousness clearly, <br>
        and I belive it will allow me to connect to others in a deeper sense as well.  <br><br>

        Having spent years writing now in my own way, <br>
        what I have discovered that I love most is free writing with a poetic twist,<br>
        formulating my refelctions, experiences, and encounters in this world in a beautiful way.<br><br>

        I do not care about proper writing ediquite or spelling or anything releated to proper english. <br><br>

        These writings are my mind on paper, and nothing less. <br><br>

        I write for myself and nobody else, though I invite others to explore my mind. <br><br>

        Anyway, thats my journey, <br>
        and I hope I write till I grow old and die, <br>
        because if there is anything I can offer this world, <br>
        I intend it to be timeless reflections that others can read and learn from, <br>
        and to extend an a beautiful new lens to how you view the world. <br>
        </p>

        <h2><u>Wants & Needs</u></h2>
        <h4><em>What is truly necessary?</em><h4>
        <p>
            I consciously attempt to not be materialistic, <br>
            and I would say I am for sure not as materialistic as most.<br><br>

            However, I still catch myself wanting particular items with reasoining rooted in superfical things,<br>
            such as particular items of clothing.<br><br>

            One facet of this materalistic side is where I want to live, and this is much mmore significant than the types of shoes I like to wear.<br><br>
            
            I imagine that I would enjoy a nice older house, on a large piece of property moderetly isolated, <br>
            and close to the shore. <br><br>

            For example, there are some beautiful estates in jamestown that fit this profile. <br><br>

            I imagine living on this estate with my wife and kids, with other family members, pets, and farm animals (i.e. horses, chickens, maybe a cow or two).<br><br>

            This imagination, however, is purly a want and nowhere near a need.<br><br>

            I wish to be very sucessful in my life yet still live a simple life; <br>
            nothing more extravagant than someone of middle class. <br><br>

            This is not becuase I would not enjoy all the luxuries of the wealthy life,<br>
            but becuase I wish to truly be happy and hold inner peace with just the necessities.<br><br>

            I wish to be a leader in my community, <br>
            and many times, the best leaders are not those who receive the best treatment,<br>
            and take advantage of this position in the herirchey,<br>
            but lift those under them. <br><br>

            The money spent on such a beautiful luxurious estate would be better utilized in a foundation, <br>
            or using the estate for purposes other than just that of residence. <br><br>

            Imagine the world where people put there money into things that actually mattered in the world and could let go of such things such as "the american dream"<br>
            which is likley the root of so much inequality in our world. <br><br>

            I do not want to play into that in the slightest.<br><br>

            I do not want to just puruse this ideology to be a better leader in the world, <br>
            but also to truly live with the philosophy "Money does not buy happiness".<br><br>

            I went to a mass at a chrstian non-denominal church for a freind of mine, and this came into light.<br>

            The pastor referenced materialistic wants, and stated that it was completly okay to want and own such items, <br>
            but to never let them control you, and always be able to give them up at once. This was his enlightted interperation of the scriptire that says to let go of all worldly possessions.<br><br>

            His messege was inspiring, not necessiarly in the message he was portrying, but the tone and passion behind his words; <br>
            it was evident that people would follow what he said based upon this.<br><br>

            The pastors message was, to me, seeming to fit what most people want to hear; you can still be morally just and worthy of the kingdom of God, as long as you do not let these earthly possessions control you.<br><br>

            Afterall, how many Christians would there be if scipture was taken just as it is written. How many of the 2.38 billion people would sell their possessions and give to the poor if they took Luke. 12:33-34 literal ..."Sell your possessions and give to the needy. Provide yourselfs with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavers that does not fail, where no theif approaches and no motth destroys. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also".<br><br>

            Yeah, not 2.38 billion. <br><br>
            
            It appears, and this is just from my observations, that the scripture evolves overtime to fit with the majority.. take gay marrige for example ("Who am I to judge?") or divorece.<br><br>

            A friend of mine talked about this extensivly over coffee one day. He had been reading a book that, at on point, compared relegion to epidemology.<br>
            The relegious interpertations that fit the time survive and those dated interperations die... it's how the relegious following continues to be popular. <br><br>

            This makes sense. 

            But I hold a personal philosophy that differs from that of the Bible, that of that pastor, that of the American Dream. <br><br>

            To me, it is rational to have what earthly posessions are necessary to make an impact in the world, sustain yourself, and your loved ones.<br><br>

            For example, average household income in Rhode Island is just under 100,000. <br><br>

            If I were to strictly live to my philosophy, I would achive a household income of just that, and the rest I would dedicate to say, a foundation or other chartible/social purposes...becuase dont get me wrong I would love to make millions... but allocate it to where it matters... not into my estate, yacht, plane, car, watch, etc. <br><br>

            I certinly want many of those things, but I belive I will be far happier in life coming to peace NOT having them than actually having them. 

            I will aim to be content with no more than the average household income.

            To me, this seems most rational for myself and a nobel pursuit. No, I could not give up all posessions, nor would I expect anybody else too.<br><br>

            To be more specific, my intent is to have enough money invested where I make the median household income via dividends (via socially responsible companies) and interest payments or rent payment (via affordable housing).<br><br>

            This buys what is most valvuable... time... time that I can use to serve others... not to indulge in a luxurious life. <br><br>

            Time with combination with being smart with a yearly 100,000 household income should be plenty enough to live a great life. <br><br>

            This ideology has already influnced life decisions of mine. <br><br>

            I had/have the opportunity to go to medical school and become a doctor, with potentiol to land myself with the highest paying salary jobs in the U.S.<br><br>

            This is not what I want to pursue in life, what I had decided on to do for a <em>career</em> will make far less than that, but with monetary not a major priority, or atleast not as high of a priority as other factors, I have choose a career path worth my life time. <br><br>

            Still, it is inevitable that I meet people all the time that value high paying jobs thinking that is the key to a better life, by their defintion anyway.<br><br>

            I hope I have the strength to follow this goal, have peace with what is affordable for an average household, and never let greed bleed into my needs. <br><br>

            I do not need a beautiful ocean front esate.<br><br>

            I need to be a leader, at the front of changing the cutural norm associted with the <em>American Dream</em>.<br><br>

            However, it is entirly possible my way may be corrupted by external factors that I will not dig into on this thread.
