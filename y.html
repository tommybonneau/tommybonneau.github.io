    <h1><u>ESSAYS</u></h1>

    <p> Anybody who spends time aroud me knows that I spend everyday journaling, <br>
      keeping my notebook and pencil by my side. <br><br>

      It brings inner peace to me when I journal, <br>
      as I have too many thoughts <em>(reflections)</em> that I keep within me. <br><br>

      Naturally, as an introvert, <br>
      I keep the majority of these reflections to myself, <br>
      though I do wish to share them. <br><br>

      Sharing our deep introspective reflecttions is, afterall, <br>
      a way we can best flourish with regard to our human nature.<br> <br>

      This creative venture is partly inspired by Marcus Aurelius (Roman Emperorr 161-180), <br>
      who had written a series of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditationspersonal writings">personal writings.</a><br><br>

       <h2><u>With Regards to the RING Activation</u></h2>

       <p>
      
      Governor, <br><br>
      
      As a representative of the National Guard, 
      I am extremely thankful for the opportunity to be activated in order to support the populations of this state so vulnerable at this time. <br><br>
      
      I joined the Rhode Island National Guard to serve my state and country in times of need, 
      at points when our state or country needs somebody to step up. <br><br>
      
      During COVID, 
      while everyone had to stay home during the initial lockdowns, 
      I was tankful to be able to respond to the emergency that was the first waves of the pandemic. <br><br>
      
      With no doubt that our military capabilities are like none other in the world,
      given the yearly budget both in a actual dollar amount and percent GDP, 
      it is good to see that funding go to use and allow the soldiers who joined for a good cause be able to live by what they believed in when they joined; helping those in need. <br><br>
      
      It saddens me to see the homeless population continue to struggle despite all that has become available to them over the years, but an imperfect state leaves individuals in a situation we hope to not find ourselves; without a home in the elements. <br><br>
      
      Even with all of the organizations, programs, and funding available to combat homelessness, there still go individuals who slip though the cracks given circumstances like they are registered sex offfenders, have a record of arson, face mental health, addiction, or are effected by urban or rural poverty more than others.<br><br>
      
      These populations need more, and again, I am endlessly grateful to be able to serve my state and those in need. <br><br>
      
      Thank you again, 
      and please continue to recognize that you have a militia of willing men and women, 
      ready and eager to help in times of need. <br><br>
      
      I say this as it was just a few weeks ago during elections that your opponent had suggested a solution to a problem you failed to see. <br><br>
      
      RIPTA, a means of public transportation utilized by thousands, especially socio-economically marginalized communities, was found to be short staffed, effectivly leaving people without essential transportation. The focus of this problem's results was children not having transportation to school. <br><br>
      
      Massachuttes just a year ago activated its national guard to drive buses, given the significant shortage of needed school bus drivers. This, as far as I know, proved effective and thus when the problem of children going without proper transportation to school, your political opponent called for you to act and activate the national guard. <br><br>
      
      Your failure to do so had left me wondering if you refused to do so for reasons far better than activating us soldiers, or if you refused to accept your opponents proposition as it would not be favorable for you during election month. <br><br>
      
      But by your activation of the National Guard in this circumstance, <br><br>
      I have more faith in your ability to lead. <br><br>
      
      Thank you. 
      
      
      </p>
      
      <br><br><br>




















       <h2><u>With Regards to the Russian Prisoner Swap</u></h2>

       <p>
      
      
      As much turmoil as there is with regards to allowing Brittany Griner, <br>
      a WNBA caught in a small possession of THC oil, <br>
      being the one freed from Russian imprisonment through the Prisoner Exchange swap over Paul Whalen, <br>
      an American Patriot, <br>
      I have decided that this was an appropriate move on behalf of the United States. <br><br>
      
      At the end of the day, <br>
      the offense of Griner compared to Whalen couldn’t be further apart. <br>
      One charge was the possession of a small amount of THC oil, <br>
      for personal use, <br>
      and widely accepted as a recreational drug in the west. <br>
      The other charge was espionage, <br>
      with possible implications ranging to a national security threat to Russia. <br><br>
      
      Given the fact that both individuals were given a fair and impartial trial, <br>
      and that the truth of the matter is that both Americans were caught committing a crime, <br>
      it is without doubt that I believe Brittany should have been given precedent regardless of her previous feelings or remarks demeaning our country. <br><br>
      
      Yes, <br>
      it would have been far better for the U.S. to get a 2 for 1 deal, <br>
      especially considering the gravity of the crimes U.S. held Russian prisoner, <br>
      Viktor Bout, A.K.A. the merchant of death had against him.<br><br>
      
      For context:<br>
      "Viktor Bout, in my eyes, is one of the most dangerous men on the face of the Earth," <br>
      Michael Braun, the former chief of operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, told "60 Minutes" in 2010.<br><br>
      
      Now on one hand, <br>
      it makes sense on behalf of the U.S. to negotiate for both Russian imprisoned U.S. citizens, <br>
      and on the other hand it makes sense for Russia to only accept a 1 for 1 trade. <br><br>
      
      However, <br>
      who has the true negotiating power here? <br><br>
      
      Russia.<br><br>
      
      Can you hear the cries by millions in Russia for the return of the Merchant of Death like you can for Brittany? <br><br>
      
      Is every celebrity in Russia talking about the unfair imprisonment of Viktor Bout like U.S. celebrities are for Griner (an exaggeration but you can’t escape this sympathy for Griner on U.S. social media)? <br><br>
      
      Does Bout’s imprisonment headline national news week after week since his imprisonment like Griner does here in the U.S.? <br><br>
      
      No, no, no. <br><br>
      
      There was an incredible amount of pressure on the President to bring Griner home, <br>
      who is seen as a victim of having to serve a severe 9 year imprisonment overseas for what would be considered only a misdemeanor in the U.S. <br><br>
      
      It is unmistakable to realize Griner’s return is a priority to the U.S., <br>
      and although many Americans are outraged that she gets to come home and Whalen has to stay, <br>
      a majority of people would be even more outraged to see the opposite; Griner stays and Whalen comes home… <br>
      or even worse… <br>
      to find out Biden had an opportunity to bring Griner home but didn’t. <br><br>
      
      Take the perspective of Russia… <br>
      they bring more to the table for negotiating then the U.S., <br>
      they have more power in this negotiation.<br><br>
      
      It’s obvious we were not going to get a 2 for 1.<br><br>
      
      We took what we could,<br>
      all considered. <br><br>
      
      Paul, by sacrificing your own freedom for that of Brittanys’ whether it was your decision to or not, <br>
      you are still serving and protecting American Citizens. <br><br>
      
      I salute you. 
      
      </p>
      
      <br><br><br>











       <h2><u>Hope for Haiti</u></h2>

       <p>
      
      
      To Whom it May Concern:<br><br>
      
      My understanding of the situation in Haiti is that there lies a humanitarian emergency resulting chiefly from the assassination of the democratically appointed president, <br>
      the temporary appointment of the role by a non democratically elected prime minister and therefore a question of legitimacy, <br>
      the uprising of control of the country via gangs who have been committing horrendous crimes in order to show power, <br>
      the outbreak of a once declared eradicate virus cholera, <br>
      and finally a request on behalf of Haiti to the us, the United States of America, to intervene with armed force. <br><br>
      
      
      I do not question the legitimacy or responsibility of my government to understand the gravity of the situation, <br>
      but I do question their inaction. I comprehend the objection to sending United States troops to Haiti durning this time, <br>
      for the reasons of not wishing to risk the lives of American troops, <br>
      the potential expense of such an intervention, <br>
      not not wishing to uphold a current questionable governing authority, <br>
      as well as other more hypothetically based speculations I will not dive into. <br><br>
      
      In fact, I am partly on the same page of the leadership of my country in their apparent plan to work with other countries militaries in order to provide armed support,<br>
      as the U.S. Military is not a world police force. <br><br>
      
      I believe that armed interventiomn from another country will still hold the same level of force necessary to make a considerable difference in Haiti with mitigated risk to the United States, <br>
      and possible other speculative benefits such as incentives to the country that decides to intervene (funding, increased political releations with the U.S. and Haiti, ect).<br><br>
      
      With that being said, what the United States can do, <br>
      is send a handful of United States subject matter experts in the fields relevant to the situation. <br><br>
      
      Not only does the United States hold an enormous amount of military and security related resources, <br>
      we also hold an arsenal of brilliant and pragmatic professionals whom would likely pounce at an opportunity to help the thousands of people driven out of their homes over the last few months, <br>
      stop the rapping and killing of thousands more including children, <br>
      and end the cholera outbreak. <br><br>
      
      Our experts will be able to truly seek what it is that Haiti needs, <br>
      and understand the means to achive the solution pragmnatially.<br><br>
      
      No, Haiti is not our country or curicial ally,<br>
      and what happens to be occurring there is not necessarily in the interest of our own national security excluding the increasing migration of Haitians into the United States, <br>
      however, it is in the interest in the best version of all of us around the world to do what we reasonably as it is not within rational and moral means to turn a blind eye or wholly put the request of support on a less capable entity. <br><br>
      
      No solution will be immediate and complete, <br>
      however, what action on behalf of the United States will provide, even if it is in a non-armed means, is hope to the Haitian people. <br><br>
      
      Hope that families do not have to decide whether between taking their child to seek medical care for cholera or stay home so they do not risk taking fire from the gangs that control the streets. <br><br>
      
      Hope that their homes will not be intruded and they themselves not raped and killed. <br><br>
      
      Hope that action is being taken to help their country, and not having to accept that this is the new way of life. <br>
      </p>
      
      <br><br><br>



    <h2><u>Connection</u></h2>
    <p>
      
      
      It hasn’t been until recently months, <br>
      
      When I find myself continuously in the same routine that I’d followed for the last few years, <br>
      
      That I have felt a deep rooted sense of discomfort. <br><br>
      
      
      To be be walking in the same shoes that I’d walked in for years, <br>
      
      with safety and stability,<br>
      
      only to be suddenly caught off guard by disconnect from what previously served as the foundation of my life?<br><br>
      
      
      It has been messing with my inner peace.<br><br>
      
      
      What’s alleviated this growing feeling of dissociation of what I believe to be the great adventure of life has been escaping into other worlds:<br>
      
      The natural world,<br>
      
      one of my own consciousness, <br>
      
      and the authentic perspective of others who can see the world in such a different and beautiful way that I do. <br><br>
      
      
      Worlds that I will forever be able to explore and learn form, <br>
      
      worlds that provide truth, <br>
      
      so the adventure of life never ends, <br>
      
      and all that is required is a connection.<br><br>
      
    </p>
      <br><br><br>

    <h2><u>Why I Write...My Journey</u></h2>

    <h4><em>This peice is going to be a working reflection. </h4></em>
        <p>
        I did not want to be a writer, <br>
        in fact I use to hate writing.<br>
        I have never been gifted at writing, <br>
        and even reading has never come naturally to me.<br><br>

        Truth is I do not know propper grammer, <br>
        and I was even put into remedial reading classes years back. <br><br>

        What I do love though, endlessly, is reflection and the art of refining my own consciousness. <br><br>

        I practice this daily, and allocate hours a week to this activity. <br>
        Reflection solves countless problems for me, internal and external,<br>
        allows me to know myself to an incredibly deep level,<br>
        helps me make decions in life that bring about inner peace through thought out principles, <br>
        etc. etc. etc.<br><br>

        The first I remember seriously reflecting was the begining highschool, <br>
        where I would spend hours a week trying to find what I wanted to do with my life, <br>
        and opportunities that were available to me. <br><br>

        Where writing came into the picture was in Basic Combat Training, where any ounce of free time I had I would write.<br>
        It was one of the few luxuries we were allowed.<br><br>

        I wrote so much about my reflections durning this time that I would go through entire notebooks, <br>
        writing upwards of 10 pages of reflections a day, <br>
        skipping showeres at times to finish my thoguhts for the day <br><br>

        I remember how I felt while in basic training, <br>
        and it was as not as you'd expect. <br>
        I was likley the happiest I'd ever been in my adult life, <br>
        and that faded once I finished basic training and stopped writing for a time.<br><br>

        The next point reflection and writings came to life were when I wrote the many drafts of my medical school personal statement. <br><br>

        These personal statements I was proud of, and it brought an incredible amount of clearity to my own rationale, <br>
        and every few months when I had written a new statement, <br>
        it was more representative of who I really was. <br><br>

        From that point on, I began to write regularly. <br><br>

        And so this leads me to today, where I write constantly, and absolutly love it. <br><br>

        Writing became a way to communite with my own consciousness clearly, <br>
        and I belive it will allow me to connect to others in a deeper sense as well.  <br><br>

        Having spent years writing now in my own way, <br>
        what I have discovered that I love most is free writing with a poetic twist,<br>
        formulating my refelctions, experiences, and encounters in this world in a beautiful way.<br><br>

        I do not care about proper writing ediquite or spelling or anything releated to proper english. <br><br>

        These writings are my mind on paper, and nothing less. <br><br>

        I write for myself and nobody else, though I invite others to explore my mind. <br><br>

        Anyway, thats my journey, <br>
        and I hope I write till I grow old and die, <br>
        because if there is anything I can offer this world, <br>
        I intend it to be timeless reflections that others can read and learn from, <br>
        and to extend an a beautiful new lens to how you view the world. <br>
        </p>

        <br><br><br>


        <h2><u>Wants & Needs</u></h2>
        <h4><em>What is truly necessary?</em><h4>
        <p>
            I consciously attempt to not be materialistic, <br>
            and I would say I am for sure not as materialistic as most.<br><br>

            However, I still catch myself wanting particular items with reasoining rooted in superfical things,<br>
            such as particular items of clothing.<br><br>

            One facet of this materalistic side is where I want to live, and this is much mmore significant than the types of shoes I like to wear.<br><br>
            
            I imagine that I would enjoy a nice older house, on a large piece of property moderetly isolated, <br>
            and close to the shore. <br><br>

            For example, there are some beautiful estates in jamestown that fit this profile. <br><br>

            I imagine living on this estate with my wife and kids, with other family members, pets, and farm animals (i.e. horses, chickens, maybe a cow or two).<br><br>

            This imagination, however, is purly a want and nowhere near a need.<br><br>

            I wish to be very sucessful in my life yet still live a simple life; <br>
            nothing more extravagant than someone of middle class. <br><br>

            This is not becuase I would not enjoy all the luxuries of the wealthy life,<br>
            but becuase I wish to truly be happy and hold inner peace with just the necessities.<br><br>

            I wish to be a leader in my community, <br>
            and many times, the best leaders are not those who receive the best treatment,<br>
            and take advantage of this position in the herirchey,<br>
            but lift those under them. <br><br>

            The money spent on such a beautiful luxurious estate would be better utilized in a foundation, <br>
            or using the estate for purposes other than just that of residence. <br><br>

            Imagine the world where people put there money into things that actually mattered in the world and could let go of such things such as "the american dream"<br>
            which is likley the root of so much inequality in our world. <br><br>

            I do not want to play into that in the slightest.<br><br>

            I do not want to just puruse this ideology to be a better leader in the world, <br>
            but also to truly live with the philosophy "Money does not buy happiness".<br><br>

            I went to a mass at a chrstian non-denominal church for a freind of mine, and this came into light.<br>

            The pastor referenced materialistic wants, and stated that it was completly okay to want and own such items, <br>
            but to never let them control you, and always be able to give them up at once. This was his enlightted interperation of the scriptire that says to let go of all worldly possessions.<br><br>

            His messege was inspiring, not necessiarly in the message he was portrying, but the tone and passion behind his words; <br>
            it was evident that people would follow what he said based upon this.<br><br>

            The pastors message was, to me, seeming to fit what most people want to hear; you can still be morally just and worthy of the kingdom of God, as long as you do not let these earthly possessions control you.<br><br>

            Afterall, how many Christians would there be if scipture was taken just as it is written. How many of the 2.38 billion people would sell their possessions and give to the poor if they took Luke. 12:33-34 literal ..."Sell your possessions and give to the needy. Provide yourselfs with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavers that does not fail, where no theif approaches and no motth destroys. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also".<br><br>

            Yeah, not 2.38 billion. <br><br>
            
            It appears, and this is just from my observations, that the scripture evolves overtime to fit with the majority.. take gay marrige for example ("Who am I to judge?") or divorece.<br><br>

            A friend of mine talked about this extensivly over coffee one day. He had been reading a book that, at on point, compared relegion to epidemology.<br>
            The relegious interpertations that fit the time survive and those dated interperations die... it's how the relegious following continues to be popular. <br><br>

            This makes sense. 

            But I hold a personal philosophy that differs from that of the Bible, that of that pastor, that of the American Dream. <br><br>

            To me, it is rational to have what earthly posessions are necessary to make an impact in the world, sustain yourself, and your loved ones.<br><br>

            For example, average household income in Rhode Island is just under 100,000. <br><br>

            If I were to strictly live to my philosophy, I would achive a household income of just that, and the rest I would dedicate to say, a foundation or other chartible/social purposes...becuase dont get me wrong I would love to make millions... but allocate it to where it matters... not into my estate, yacht, plane, car, watch, etc. <br><br>

            I certinly want many of those things, but I belive I will be far happier in life coming to peace NOT having them than actually having them. 

            I will aim to be content with no more than the average household income.

            To me, this seems most rational for myself and a nobel pursuit. No, I could not give up all posessions, nor would I expect anybody else too.<br><br>

            To be more specific, my intent is to have enough money invested where I make the median household income via dividends (via socially responsible companies) and interest payments or rent payment (via affordable housing).<br><br>

            This buys what is most valvuable... time... time that I can use to serve others... not to indulge in a luxurious life. <br><br>

            Time with combination with being smart with a yearly 100,000 household income should be plenty enough to live a great life. <br><br>

            This ideology has already influnced life decisions of mine. <br><br>

            I had/have the opportunity to go to medical school and become a doctor, with potentiol to land myself with the highest paying salary jobs in the U.S.<br><br>

            This is not what I want to pursue in life, what I had decided on to do for a <em>career</em> will make far less than that, but with monetary not a major priority, or atleast not as high of a priority as other factors, I have choose a career path worth my life time. <br><br>

            Still, it is inevitable that I meet people all the time that value high paying jobs thinking that is the key to a better life, by their defintion anyway.<br><br>

            I hope I have the strength to follow this goal, have peace with what is affordable for an average household, and never let greed bleed into my needs. <br><br>

            I do not need a beautiful ocean front esate.<br><br>

            I need to be a leader, at the front of changing the cutural norm associted with the <em>American Dream</em>.<br><br>

            However, it is entirly possible my way may be corrupted by external factors that I will not dig into on this thread.

        Unsurprisingly, the Taliban has decided to go back on their word that all girls would be allowed to go to school, as they had been able to for 20 years prior to the Taliban regaining control in afghanistan. <br><br>

        Afterall, it was only 20 years ago since the Taliban previously reigned in Afganistan and barred girls from attending school before, murdering those, including children, who opposed their ideology. <br><br>
        
        However, this time around, they had only banned girls at the 6th grade level and on.<br><br>
        
        There was no cancelation announcement for secondary school girls attempting to attend classes on the scheduled opening day. Instead, they arrived at class, yet were turned away, some with the wave of a hand, others with a wave of a 7.62mm caliber AK-47 assult rifle. <br><br>
        
        The Taliban's ambassador the the United Nations gave a statement regarding that this barring of girls from attending secondary education was only temporary, stating it was only a matter of a uniform issue to be resolved soon. This statement, however, I have no confidence in. An organization whose ranks are filled with a variety of extremists will not follow along with a spokesperson's promises; a puppet who was likely picked and trained to tailor towards western minds. <br><br>
        
        They also allow women to attend Universities; Taliban controlled universities that is. Taliban controlled curriculum, dress code, classroom policies (i.e. segregation of men and women), and Taliban approved instructors. <br><br>
        
        So they have barred girls from receiving a secondary education and make it unbearable for women to go to university. Assuming the requirements for university is having a secondary education, and the barring of girls from attending 6th grade on, it will only be a matter of time till there are no more girls being education past 12 years old. <br><br>

        I would argue the Taliban is strategizing to get what they want while walking on eggshells to not outrage the western world as much as it had done in the past, allowing them to get away with their oppressive methods. <br>

        Thankfully, it appears girls and women still have access to education though books and the internet. <br><br>

        To the girls and women of Afghanistan, do not give up hope. <br><br>
