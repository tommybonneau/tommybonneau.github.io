      When you close your eyes, <br>
      do you find answeres here,<br>
      or are you afraid of the dark? <br>

    <h2><u>Mirror</u></h2>

    <h4><em>A short fictional story based on a personal dream</h4></em>

        <p>
            I had looked far too long, <br>
            longer than I'd ever had before, <br>
            too long to just neglect what presents itself before me. <br><br>

            A glace turned into a glare, <br>
            a glare to a stare, <br>
            a reflection of me.<br><br>

            An unideal self, <br>
            and the picture enriched an underlying rage within me,<br>
            and surfaced a reaction I could not stand to resist at the moment. <br><br>

            I striked the reflection. <br><br>

            Just a crack,<br>
            spitting the image in two. <br>
            separating the old perspective into two new. <br><br>

            This new reflection brought a slight ease to my mind, <br>
            but it was not enough. <br><br>

            I struck again, <br>
            new shards, <br>
            new perspectives.<br><br>

            Till pieces of the mirror shattered off the wall, <br>
            and the once perfectly circular flat mirror which once before gave such sharp portrait of oneself <br>
            now gave a scattered and and shattered shape, <br><br>
            one of a heart.<br><br>

            My actions were a destructive relief that created something beautiful.<br><br>

            A lens of love and acceptance of imperfection. <br>
        </p>
