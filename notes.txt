Before I had an outline for a story, 

It was not a unique story, 
or creative, 
and just the same as the easily imaginable narratives
written time and time again, 
throughout the history of modern civilization. 

Works that were all too familiar and comfortable, 
and did not spark too much passion, fear, excitement. 

Each chapter of my story easily predictable, 
with the protagonist easily lost in the crowd of other characters. 

The story was uneventful, 
and left I, 
the writer, 
curious if it was worth my lifetime to finish it. 

Afterall, 
who would ever want to pick up and read such a monotonous tale, 
one a reader could have easily written themselves. 

Or would it be better to start with a blank page, 
a page that I would now have the chance to write something magnificent, 
a chronicle so original and ingenious it would become the next story millions in history would decide to read,
a magnum opus of literature. 

The story is of the life we all choose to create for ourselves.
