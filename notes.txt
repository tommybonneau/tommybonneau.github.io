Those who seek the truth are blind to it,
and those who find it hide from it. 









































The last 5 years I had spent building my new home, 
a boat that would sail down the river that bordered my property,
and take me to a place not yet imagianble. 

I have spend the entirety of my life beside the river, 
on the same plot of land the generations before me held as well. 

Up untill 5 years ago, 
I had been a daughter, 
and a sister, 
but now, 
I am only alone. 

My parents had died of old age, 
and my brother had drowned in the very river I wish to travel down,
in attempt to fetch the herbs necessary to cure the illness our youngest contracted.

But now, 
I am only alone.

To build such a beautiful boat, 
it took the forest of our land, 
the structure of our home, 
and the will of anger, dispair, guilt, 
but most importantly,
the hope of a better and new life down the river. 

And today, 
it stands glorious in it's completion. 

It is named Delhi. 

I round up the animals I've looked after all this time,
my dog, 
one cow, 
one horse, 
one pig, 
one sheep. 


The last obstance that stands in the way of my journey is the cutting of the tree-bark rope that holds the boat ashore. 

As I board the ship, 
I thank the land that has provided life for I and my generations all these years, 
and I say goodbye in the spirit of a new life,
a life worth living, 
a life of exploration and pushing of boundaries, 
to places only I have yet to imagine in my bloodline.

I cut the rope and I sail off, 
and I imagine the spirit of my family waving me off. 

I travel for as
