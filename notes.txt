To walk into a library, 
my breath is easily taken from my chest, 
and is replaced by an air of inspiration.

I am here for a chance to find the answers to the great questions of life.

I walk though library, 
as I drift into great minds of humanity, 
and become lost in the seemingly endless columns and rows of man's written word. 

There are scholars everywhere, 
shoulder to shoulder,
all looking for the answers. 

I have to nudge and grind past others to move.

We are all lost,
more confused and hopeless than we were when we began our respected studies. 

It's been years now for me,
and I am no closer to the answers, 
the truth. 

The air becomes clouded, still, 
and color slowly dissipates. 

All that I smell is that of aged books. 

One sholar says there is but one book to find the answers, 
and he hands it to me. 

I read it, 
over and over for awhile, 
but alas it brings him no closer to the truth, 
and he himself is lost in the library. 

Another scholar had spent his lifetime here in the library, 
absorbing all the he can, 
saying that the only way out is to read it all, 
and then the answers will become clear,
but alas this progress brings him no closer to the truth,
and he himself is lost in the library. 

I will die here I thought,
as it is futile to look for answers here. 

A thousand lifetimes may be spent here with the production of any truth.

I climb the bookshelves and look over the library. 

It is only here, 
on top of the written word, 
that I can see a glimpse of a light. 

I walk closer, 
and alone for the first time since I've been here. 

I advance none towards reaching the light. 

I've been traveling for as long as time has existed it seems.

I feel so close yet forever away
and so I sit,
and finally lay. 

It's time I rested. 

I feel at ease now, 
accepting that I will not achieve the truth. 

I close my eyes, 
tired of reading, 
tired of searching.

It is only here, 
where I achieved inner peace for the first time since coming here. 

I fall into a slumber, 
welcoming death.

A breeze flows over me. 

He has come I thought, 
but when I open my eyes, 
the color of the bright sky nearly blinds me,
and for the first time in my life,
I feel alive. 

I look around, 
and find the answers Iâ€™ve been looking for. 

The Truth.
