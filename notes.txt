        <p>
            As I walk into this library, <br>
            my breath is easily taken from my chest, <br>
            and is replaced by an air of inspiration.<br><br>

            I came here for a chance to find the answers to the great questions of life.<br><br>

            When I go to check in, 
            there are three columns to be filled on the booklet:

            NAME, 
            CHECK IN TIME,
            CHECK OUT TIME.

            Only the first two are filled out for as many pages as I went back;
            there ought to be hundreds,
            maybe thousands here that checked in just this morning. 

            Afterall, it was no small library,
            as any written work thoughout hisotry may be found in this library, 
            and it grows indefinetly long, 
            as the expansion of space and time itself. 

            I walk though marble encapsulated building, <br>
            and as I drift into great minds of humanity, <br>
            I become lost in the seemingly endless columns and rows of man's written word. <br><br>

            There are scholars like myself everywhere, <br>
            shoulder to shoulder,<br>
            here on the same quest,<br>
            all looking for the answers. <br><br>

            I have to nudge and grind past others just to move a single pace.<br><br>

            The air becomes dense, foggy, still, <br>
            and the color of the world slowly dissipates. <br><br>

            All that I smell is that of aged pages. <br><br>

            The entire time I have been here I have only seen two walls, 
            only the shelves of the written word that were perpendicular to myself as I traveled. 

            I have lost all proproception of where the exit is. 

            It has been rumored that only those that find the truth may leave, 
            or die here. 

            It's been years now for me since I've arrived,<br>
            and I am no closer to the answers, <br>
            the truth. <br><br>

            Such different perspectives.

            Such a variety of conclusions. 

            All along my journey,
            there are men who have stopped traveling thoughout the library, 
            and preach that they have found the answers, 
            and thus the way out of this forsaken library. 

            One scholar says there is but one book to find the answers, <br>
            and he hands it to me. <br><br>

            I read it, <br>
            over and over for awhile, <br>
            but alas it brings him no closer to the truth, <br>
            and this false prophet too is lost in the library.<br><br>
  
            Another scholar had spent his lifetime here in the library, <br>
            absorbing all the he can, <br>
            saying that the only way out is to read it all, <br>
            and then the answers will become clear,<br>
            but alas this progress brings him no closer to the truth,<br>
            and this false prophet too is lost in the library.<br><br>

            I will die here I thought,<br>
            as it is futile to look for answers here. <br><br>

            A thousand lifetimes may be spent here without the production of any truth.<br>
            and I've been traveling for as long as time has existed.<br><br>

            I feel so close yet forever away, <br>
            and each day of study I felt a made a step closer,<br>
            to a objective moving just as fast away from me.<br><br>

            I climb the bookshelves and look over the library. <br><br>

            The view from atop the shelves is astonishing.

            It is obvious now from up here, <br>
            that the forever stretching library was indeed not such, <br>
            but rather a circle that us scholars have been falsely following for eternity,<br>
            trapped in our own heads.<br><br>

            So I lay,<br>
            lay atop the answers other men have found
            in a failed attempt to make their subpar answers my own. <br><br>

            I felt at ease now, <br>
            accepting that I will not achieve what I checked into the library to find. <br><br>

            I close my eyes, <br>
            tired of reading, <br>
            tired of searching, <br>
            and I forget of the competing ideas that have clouded any glimpse of my own orgianl thought. <br><br>

            I fall into a slumber, <br>
            welcoming death.<br><br>

            It is only here, <br>
            where I achieved inner peace for the first time since coming here. <br><br>

            Accepting death allowed me to feel alive.

            A breeze flows over me, 
            and I let go. <br><br>

            He has come I thought. <br>

            And all hat I longed for comes to me, 
            in a rush of self-revelation.

            When I open my eyes, <br>
            I am on top of the world.

        </p>

        <strong>The Truth. </strong><br><br>










I am back to my old self.  

            I look around with a new lens, <br>
            finding the answers Iâ€™ve been looking for, <br>
            and I begin to weep.
