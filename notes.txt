The Mirror 

I had looked far too long, 
longer than I'd ever had before, 
too long to just neglect what presents itself before me. 

A glace turned into a glare, 
a glare to a stare, 
a reflection of me.

An unideal self, 
and the picture enriched an underlying rage within me,
and surfaced a reaction I could not stand to resist at the moment. 

I striked the reflection. 

Just a crack,
spitting the image in two. 
separating the old perspective into two new. 

This new reflection brought a slight ease to my mind, 
but it was not enough. 

I struck again, 
new shards, 
new perspectives.

Till pieces of the mirror shattered off the wall, 
and the once perfectly circular flat mirror which once before gave such sharp portrait of oneself 
now gave a scattered and and shattered shape, 
one of a heart.

My actions were a destructive relief that created something beautiful.

A lens of love and acceptance of imperfection. 
























































The last 5 years I had spent building my new home, 
a boat that would sail down the river that bordered my property,
and take me to a place not yet imagianble. 

I have spend the entirety of my life beside the river, 
on the same plot of land the generations before me held as well. 

Up untill 5 years ago, 
I had been a daughter, 
and a sister, 
but now, 
I am only alone. 

To build such a beautiful boat, 
it took the forest of our land, 
the structure of our home, 
and the will of anger, dispair, guilt, 
but most importantly,
the hope of a better and new life down the river. 

And today, 
it stands glorious in it's completion. 

It is named Delhi. 

As I board the ship, 
I thank the land that has provided life for I and my generations all these years, 
and I say goodbye in the spirit of a new life,
a life worth living, 
a life of exploration and pushing of boundaries, 
to places only I have yet to imagine in my bloodline.

I cut the rope and I sail off, 
and I imagine the spirit of my family waving me off. 

All changes once I begin sailing, 

The elements of the world itself, 









A personal project
