I begin to walk for a slow and steady pace,<br><br>

through the forest of the Amazon, <br>
throguh the plains of the Africana Savana, <br>
through the sands of the Sahara<br>
through the tundra of Siberia,<br>
through the mountian tops of the Himalayas, <br>
through the oceans of the Mediterian, <br>
through center of the earth and hell I stood above<br>
through the stars and heaven I gazed from below, <br>
through time, <br><br>

and finally my journey resides, <br>
to rest where my heart lies, <br>
in the arms of the one I call my love, <br>
at the place I find peace, <br>
my home. <br>












































The last 5 years I had spent building my new home, 
a boat that would sail down the river that bordered my property,
and take me to a place not yet imagianble. 

I have spend the entirety of my life beside the river, 
on the same plot of land the generations before me held as well. 

Up untill 5 years ago, 
I had been a daughter, 
and a sister, 
but now, 
I am only alone. 

To build such a beautiful boat, 
it took the forest of our land, 
the structure of our home, 
and the will of anger, dispair, guilt, 
but most importantly,
the hope of a better and new life down the river. 

And today, 
it stands glorious in it's completion. 

It is named Delhi. 

As I board the ship, 
I thank the land that has provided life for I and my generations all these years, 
and I say goodbye in the spirit of a new life,
a life worth living, 
a life of exploration and pushing of boundaries, 
to places only I have yet to imagine in my bloodline.

I cut the rope and I sail off, 
and I imagine the spirit of my family waving me off. 

All changes once I begin sailing, 

The elements of the world itself,
