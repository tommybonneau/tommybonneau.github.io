            <h2><u>Wants & Needs</u></h2>
            <h4><em>What is truly necessary?</em><h4>
            <p>
                I consciously attempt to not be materialistic, <br>
                and I would say I am for sure not as materialistic as most.<br><br>

                However, I still catch myself wanting particular items with reasoining rooted in superfical things,<br>
                such as particular items of clothing.<br><br>

                One facet of this materalistic side is where I want to live, and this is much mmore significant than the types of shoes I like to wear.<br><br>
                
                I imagine that I would enjoy a nice older house, on a large piece of property moderetly isolated, <br>
                and close to the shore. <br><br>

                For example, there are some beautiful estates in jamestown that fit this profile. <br><br>

                I imagine living on this estate with my wife and kids, with other family members, pets, and farm animals (i.e. horses, chickens, maybe a cow or two).<br><br>

                This imagination, however, is purly a want and nowhere near a need.<br><br>

                I wish to be very sucessful in my life yet still live a simple life; <br>
                nothing more extravagant than someone of middle class. <br><br>

                This is not becuase I would not enjoy all the luxuries of the wealthy life,<br>
                but becuase I wish to truly be happy and hold inner peace with just the necessities.<br><br>

                I wish to be a leader in my community, <br>
                and many times, the best leaders are not those who receive the best treatment,<br>
                and take advantage of this position in the herirchey,<br>
                but lift those under them. <br><br>

                The money spent on such a beautiful luxurious estate would be better utilized in a foundation, <br>
                or using the estate for purposes other than just that of residence. <br><br>

                Imagine the world where people put there money into things that actually mattered in the world and could let go of such things such as "the american dream"<br>
                which is likley the root of so much inequality in our world. <br><br>

                I do not want to play into that in the slightest.<br><br>

                I do not want to just puruse this ideology to be a better leader in the world, <br>
                but also to truly live with the philosophy "Money does not buy happiness".<br><br>

                I went to a mass at a chrstian non-denominal church for a freind of mine, and this came into light.<br>

                The pastor referenced materialistic wants, and stated that it was completly okay to want and own such items, <br>
                but to never let them control you, and always be able to give them up at once. This was his enlightted interperation of the scriptire that says to let go of all worldly possessions.<br><br>

                His messege was inspiring, not necessiarly in the message he was portrying, but the tone and passion behind his words; <br>
                it was evident that people would follow what he said based upon this.<br><br>

                The pastors message was, to me, seeming to fit what most people want to hear; you can still be morally just and worthy of the kingdom of God, as long as you do not let these earthly possessions control you.<br><br>

                Afterall, how many Christians would there be if scipture was taken just as it is written. How many of the 2.38 billion people would sell their possessions and give to the poor if they took Luke. 12:33-34 literal ..."Sell your possessions and give to the needy. Provide yourselfs with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavers that does not fail, where no theif approaches and no motth destroys. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also".<br><br>

                Yeah, not 2.38 billion. <br><br>
                
                It appears, and this is just from my observations, that the scripture evolves overtime to fit with the majority.. take gay marrige for example ("Who am I to judge?") or divorece.<br><br>

                A friend of mine talked about this extensivly over coffee one day. He had been reading a book that, at on point, compared relegion to epidemology.<br>
                The relegious interpertations that fit the time survive and those dated interperations die... it's how the relegious following continues to be popular. <br><br>

                This makes sense. 

                But I hold a personal philosophy that differs from that of the Bible, that of that pastor, that of the American Dream. <br><br>

                To me, it is rational to have what earthly posessions are necessary to make an impact in the world, sustain yourself, and your loved ones.<br><br>

                For example, average household income in Rhode Island is just under 100,000. <br><br>

                If I were to strictly live to my philosophy, I would achive a household income of just that, and the rest I would dedicate to say, a foundation or other chartible/social purposes...becuase dont get me wrong I would love to make millions... but allocate it to where it matters... not into my estate, yacht, plane, car, watch, etc. <br><br>

                I certinly want many of those things, but I belive I will be far happier in life coming to peace NOT having them than actually having them. 

                I will aim to be content with no more than the average household income.

                To me, this seems most rational for myself and a nobel pursuit. No, I could not give up all posessions, nor would I expect anybody else too.<br><br>

                To be more specific, my intent is to have enough money invested where I make the median household income via dividends (via socially responsible companies) and interest payments or rent payment (via affordable housing).<br><br>

                This buys what is most valvuable... time... time that I can use to serve others... not to indulge in a luxurious life. <br><br>

                Time with combination with being smart with a yearly 100,000 household income should be plenty enough to live a great life. <br><br>

                This ideology has already influnced life decisions of mine. <br><br>

                I had/have the opportunity to go to medical school and become a doctor, with potentiol to land myself with the highest paying salary jobs in the U.S.<br><br>

                This is not what I want to pursue in life, what I had decided on to do for a <em>career</em> will make far less than that, but with monetary not a major priority, or atleast not as high of a priority as other factors, I have choose a career path worth my life time. <br><br>

                Still, it is inevitable that I meet people all the time that value high paying jobs thinking that is the key to a better life, by their defintion anyway.<br><br>

                I hope I have the strength to follow this goal, have peace with what is affordable for an average household, and never let greed bleed into my needs. <br><br>

                I do not need a beautiful ocean front esate.<br><br>

                I need to be a leader, at the front of changing the cutural norm associted with the <em>American Dream</em>.<br><br>

                However, it is entirly possible my way may be corrupted by external factors that I will not dig into on this thread. 

            </p>

                <strong>Fight Greed with Me.</strong><br><br>

            <h2><u>Why I Write</u></h2>
            <h4><em>My Journey</em><h4>
            <p>
            This peice is going to be a working reflection. <br><br>

            I did not want to be a writer, <br>
            in fact I use to hate writing, <br>
            and even more reading. <br><br>

            I have never been gifted at writing, <br>
            and reading has never come naturally to me.<br><br>

            Truth is I do not know propper grammer, <br>
            my vocabulary is lacking, <br>
            and I was even put into remedial reading classes years back. <br><br>

            What I do love though, endlessly, is reflection and the art of refining my own consciousness. <br><br>

            I practice this daily, and allocate hours a week to this activity. <br>

            Reflection solves countless problems for me, internal and external,<br>
            allows me to know myself to an incredibly deep level (allowing me to have a high emotinal intelligence overall),<br>
            helps me make decions in life that bring about inner peace through thought out principles, <br>
            etc. etc. etc.<br><br>

            The first I remember seriously reflecting was begining highschool, <br>
            where I would spend hours a week trying to find what I wanted to do with my life, <br>
            and opportunities that were available to me; it's how I found out about the National Guard.<br><br>

            Where writing came into the picture was in Basic Combat Training, where any ounce of free time I had I would write.<br><br>

            These writings came in the form of letters that I would send to my girlfriend at that time for the most part. <br>
            I wrote so much about my reflections durning this time that I would go through entire notebooks, <br>
            writing upwards of 10 pages of reflections a day. <br><br>

            I wrote so much that I would skip showers to have more time to write, <br>
            and I even got my notebook taken by the drill sergent and the platoon in trouble once.<br><br>

            However, when basic training had finished, and I no longer had to communicate with others via letters, I stopped... for years. <br><br>

            The next point reflection and writings came to life were when I wrote the many drafts of my medical school personal statement. <br><br>

            These personal statements I was proud of, and it brought an incredible amount of clearity to my own rationale. <br><br>

            From that point on, I began to write regularly.  <br><br>

            And so this leads me to today, where I write constantly, and absolutly love it. <br><br>

            Still, I write for myself and nobody else. <br>
            I have only shared the link to my reflections journal to a few, as in I think two people(maybe three?), <br>
            though I have shared a glimpse of my writing here and there.<br><br>

            Soon, I wish to build the confidence to start sharing my page with more people, <br>
            as I know it could allow me to connect with others on a deeper, nonsuperfical way, <br>
            (which makes up most encounters with others.. quite frustrating to me).<br><br>

            Anyway, thats my journey, <br>
            and I hope I write till I grow old and die, <br>
            because if there is anything I can offer this world, <br>
            I hope what becomes most valuable is timeless reflections others can read and learn from, <br>
            as I had whist thinking and writing them.

            <p>
            "Hello, I like your pen.<br>
            Today I am at the beach with you. <br>
            You seemed happy today at the Zoo. <br>
            I like to see your inquisite face reading all of the signs and exploring.<br>
            You are so attentive to the animals, espically otters, as they swim by.<br><br>
            
            I think activites like that bring out your inner child, <br>
            observing new beings and learning about them.<br>
            You have a deeper appreaciation for those kinds of things.<br><br>
            
            Today, I also learned something new about you... <br>
            that you feel and experience life and memories so deeply,<br>
            almost like you are re-living the past, <br>
            like when you talked about the sound of the highway and your memories of the Zoo.<br><br>

            I hope we can have more fun days like this...

            <h2><u>Entend your Lifetime</u></h2>
            <h4><em>Awake and Alive</em><h4>
            <p>
            This morning we woke to see break of dawn,<br>
            as I only have a few more days of absolute freedom before I go away for work for a few weeks, <br>
            and start up school shortly after. <br><br>
            
            I've been looking for more hours in my day,<br>
            to make the most of my days left,  <br>
            and so we departed for the coast line for sun up.<br><br>

            The view itself was spectaculatr, <br>
            though most impressive was the extra amount of time I've contributed to my day by waking up early. <br>

            No, I had not contributed a riduclous amount of hours to my day by awaking early, <br>
            though the illusion of having done so was all too real. <br>

            I felt as though those extra hours, having been spent well, gave the impression that I had lived two days in one. <br><br>

            Many times I attempt to wake early, though my half conscious self wishing to sleep succeedes without fail.<br>
            Thoughs of feeling slow and groggy trick my mind into just sleeping in when appropriate, <br>
            regardless of if I've alredy had enough hours to sleep or not... as if I even keep track 99% of the time. <br><br>

            But I loved this morning I dragged myself out of bed to the coast to witness the sun break over the horizon, <br>
            reflecting off the ripples of the seemingly endless sea. <br><br>

            The reflection I had was do not let your subconscious play tricks on you. <br><br>

            You will be happier awake, making the most of life. <br><br>

            Some quick math (sorry):<br>
                I am 22 years old.<br>
                Life expectancy for a U.S. male is approximatly 79 years old. <br><br>

                I have 57 years till my expected death.<br><br>

                With 57 years, 365 days, and waking 1 hour eariler each day (on average),<br>
                that equivaltes tto 20,805 hours added to my conscious life. <br><br>

                If I am conscious 17 hours a day (7 hours asleep), <br>
                then this extra time will equate to about 40 months worth of conscious life.<br><br>
                
            Theres my answer on how to live longer. <br><br>

            Who needs longer telomeres when you can just wake up earlier!<br><br>

            I suppose you could also argue staying up later may work for some, but just not for me.<br><br>

            I enjoy daylight hours more than nightime.

        <h4><em>What keeps me sane.</em><h4>
        <p>
           Today is day two of many in the field. <br>
           I hold inner peace, though I know I will be away from my loved ones for a few weeks and put to hard work & out of my comfort zone.<br><br>

           I am at peace, and bring no dispair to the field, as I had plenty fun before I had to leave. <br><br>

           The truth is that because I knew I was leaving, with only a little summer left when I return home, I knew I had to enjoy myself the last few days I had freedom before the field.<br><br>

           The last few days I put aside my work, and made it my cheif priority to enjoy myself, and what fun I had in a few days was suprising and fulfilling.<br><br>

           This included:<br>
            going to get sushi x 2,<br>
            going to get mexican drinks x 2<br>
            going to the beach for sunset durning high tide x 2 <br>
            getting morning coffee x 2<br>
            having deep and meaningful conversations <br>
            making love, <br>
            watching the sunrise x 2 (early!)<br>
            and one of my favorites... going to the zoo. <br><br>

           Each of these experiences was incredibly meaningful to me, <br>

            <p>
               Out of the trench and over the wall,<br>
               I find myself crawling, clinging my body to the ground as <br>
               sounds of machine guns fire and bullets fly overhead<br>
               along with the bass that is mortor rounds impacting nearby. <br><br>
               
               The vibrations carry through the hands that cling the earth, <br>
               and that of my rifle.<br><br>
               
               The dark night is only illuminated by that of the tracer rounds <br>
               and raw energy derived from explosives and flames. <br><br>
               
               I keep pulling my body foward, only seeing my hands in front of me.<br><br>
               
               My hands, my hands, similar in size and shapes to those who crawl next to me, <br>
               similar to those who fire at me.<br><br>
               
               But Déjà Vu strikes as I look at my hands, <br>
               as it was only a decade ago, where these were hands of just a child.<br><br>
               
               They are the same hands, afterall.<br><br>
               
               It felt like yestrerday.<br><br>
               
               But tonight, these hands move me and save my life, <br><br>
               
               so I can that of anothers tomarrow.

                  And with nobody around to hear my cries of help,<br>
                  I stay silent, and fall to my knees, at the feet of brother.<br><br>

               Flames flared high, <br>
               and hot?<br><br>

               No, my conscience illuminated a mere visual <br>
               what I can only describe as the center of volcano.<br><br>

               Theres a tint to my vision, <br>

               orange,<br>

               I'm woozy.<br><br>

               offbalance,<br>
               into the dream my mind manifested<br>
               my flesh would surly conflagrate, <br>
               and my soul combust.<br><br>

               ...<br><br>

               But as if a blink of the eye <br>
               could extinguish the world,<br>
               perhaps from a tear, <br>
               this alternae world my mind forged,<br>

                in the distince as I lay at night. <br><br>

                Today,

                that will forever be more aesthetically pleasing<br>
                than anything I can create. <br><br>

                But emotion,<br>
                Passion;<br>
                these make art beautiful. <br><br>

                And for that, <br>
                life forever stays nothing less than, <br><br>

                beautiful.

                    I finished the pages of my last hours before. <br><br>

                    with the paper of my new journal awaiting ink inscription, <br>
                    though I achived what I'd been seeking as I venture into the dead of night on this vacant dimly lit road;<br><br>

                    The stress of my life that seems so trival now retreats, <br>

                  And nothing brings my joy like seeing a friendly face everywhere I go, <br>
                  whether it be my barista, my classmates, the librian, <br>
                  or the oddly similar philosphical kid I run into on the daily. <br><br>

              <p> 
                  I belive the most intellectal self does not reside in books, conversations, or the higher education system, <br>
                  but within my own conscious. <br><br>
  
                  To ask myself who, what, why is important, <br>
                  and not only learn, <br>
                  but critically refect on what infomation I recieve. <br><br>
  
                  What concepts, ideas, solutions come to mind? <br><br>
  
                  I belive books, education, and conversations are a great way to stimulate the mind, <br>
                  but reflection is taking these stimulates and asking more from them. <br><br>
  
                  Knowing facts is simmply not enough, nor should it even be valued in a age of techonoly. <br>
                  Hence is why examinations that test factual knowlahe commit a diservice to students. <br><br>

              <p> 
                  Though I, in the past few years, have felt strongly about the pusuit of helping othes day-to-day<br>
                  whilst in the pursut of a greater good,<br>
                  I latley have been feeling as though,<br>
                  at this point in my life atleast,<br>
                  volunteering at any position is not the best means to serve others in my life. <br><br>
      
                  Instead, I have felt a calling to filling my spare time in pursuits such as reading and writing. <br><br>
      
                  Though they may not serve others at this moment, <br>
                  I feel as though I am building a foundation for greater things. <br><br>
      
                  At a age of 22, I feel as though this, above all things, is a necessity to make my lifes impact. <br><br>
      
                  However, this priority is only temporary. <br>
                  I will at some point decide to move focus onto executiing my mission, <br>
                  opposed to builidng up my character and intellect, <br>
                  otherwise the foundation is worthless. <br><br>
      
                  Maybe after twenty-five, fifty, one-hundred books read, <br>
                  after one, three, five years writing, <br>
                  after years of working, traveling to the cornes of the earth, <br>
                  may I have any thoughts remotly worth something twords the world, <br>
                  or words worth sharing to help mankind. <br><br>
      
                  Or shall we hold the belief that anybody can transcend civilization? <br><br>
      
                  Although this may be true, I do not belive it so for me. <br><br>
      
                  I need to educate myself, <br>
                  to a level not achived my most, <br>
                  and use it in the most substantial way, <br>

              <h2><u>Mortality</u></h2>
              <p> It was only days before the first of spring, <br>
                  and the birds, evidently, were livley on this refreshingly warm day.  <br> <br>
      
                  As was we, endervering on a hike atop this hill.  <br> <br>
      
                  We had paid little attention to the beauty that encompassed the journey to the peak,  <br>
                  apart from the relativly flat aspect of the trip,  <br>
                  where eyes were free.  <br>
                  Of course this was due to the rockey hillside which demanded attention whilst climbing, <br>
                  unless one wanted to know the taste of gneiss or granite.  <br> <br>
      
                  But coming to the top,  <br>
                  and finally having the opportunity to bear the fruits of our labor,  <br>
                  I peared off into the distince. <br> <br>
      
                  Miles of tall red oaks,  <br>
                  that appear stiff and lifeless.  <br> <br>
      
                  <em>A sea of death</em> I thought.  <br> <br>
      
                  Though this of course was not true. <br>
                  The oaks, whether or not it was evident,  <br>
                  were alive and well; they would outlive me, afternall.  <br> <br>
      
                  The mortality I hold was reminded to me on the downslope,  <br>
                  watching two vulchers encirle us. They I would certinly would outlive,  <br>
                  though I know they had wished it not so. They were not, could not, expect me to provide for them. <br> <br>
      
                  Maybe it was the elderly dog accompanying us that the scavengers had become keen on.  <br> <br>
      
                  Maybe in a months time,  <br>
                  the sea of death would finish its tide,  <br>
                  and bring about budding, bird songs, and an air of life.  <br> <br>
      
                  <strong>Death brings about life.</strong><br>

              <p>
                 Two left turning lanes approach, <br>
                 only one of which is filled with vechicles;<br>
                 the right one. <br><br>
      
                 The left lane hugged a median. <br>
                 A homeless man stood there,<br>
                 next to an break in traffic, <br>
                 next to spot to which I poitioned my SUV.<br><br>
      
                 I looked at him as I drive up. <br><br>
      
                 His complexion dark, <br>
                 scruffy, <br>
                 bulky,<br>
                 yet he held inviting eyes, <br>
                 that looked not at me but into distince. <br>
                 He looked cold.<br><br>
      
                 His creased cardboard sign with sharpie read <br>
                 "Anything Helps". <br>
                 Most, including the sign weilder, <br>
                 may assume this means monetary help. <br>
                 Though I take it literally, <br>
                 and offer what I can,<br>
                 wheter it be a gronala bar, <br>
                 a bottled water, <br>
                 or a simple hello. <br><br>
      
                 Unsusal for me, <br>
                 I felt complelled to open my wallet.<br>
                 Two bills; <br>
                 One worth a single dollar and another worth twenty. <br><br>
      
                 Pinching the dollar, <br>
                 I'd observed what I obtained earlier in the week for myself, <br>
                 still unsued, unopened, but there if I <em>wanted</em> it. <br>
                 But here, I thought this man may <em>need</em> it as I did just years ago. <br><br>
      
                 Rolling down my window, <br>
                 his those inviting eyes made contact with mine, <br>
                 followed with a contagious smile. <br>
                 The front teeth mising made no difference. <br>
                 I smiled back, with a few words exchanged. <br><br>
      
                 Out my hand reached,<br> 
                 holding a book with a bill I placed in between random pages.<br><br>
                 
                 A new testament, <br>
                 pocket-edition. <br><br>
      
                 His grin widened, <br>
                 his voice pitch raised with excitment. <br>
                 He had told me he had lost his other bible, <br>
                 and that he wished he hadn't as he reads it in his tent at night. <br>
                 He had made reference to Him durning our conversation,<br>
                 pointing above, <br>
                 beliving in the signs He provides. <br><br>
      
                 Moments passed, and I drove away. <br><br>
      
                 I felt a mix of emotions. <br><br>
      
                 Shame, <br>
                 I felt for him, <br>
                 looking though his eyes, <br>
                 at the cars who decided to stay away in the futher lane. <br><br>
      
                 Disipointment, <br>
                 for those in the cars, <br>
                 being less comfortable next to a man in need, <br>
                 than with themelvess for wanting to avoid any interaction, <br>
                 even eye contact.<br>
                 But those in the cars were no different that I just a few years ago.<br><br>
      
                 Joy, <br>
                 which was not derived from the feeling of helping a person in need, <br>
                 but from the reflection of his expresion when I offered him a single bill, <br>
                 along with text of wisdom. <br><br>
      
                 Curiousity, <br>
                 as I questioned myself,<br> 
                 for not giving the man a $20. <br>
                 I did not want to give it to him. <br>
                 But why? <br>
                 Had I thought I needed it more?<br>
                 Had I thought I deserved it more?<br>
                 Had I thought I would spend it better?<br><br>
      
                 And why had he been staring off into the distince? <br>
                 Was he thinking? <br>
                 Dozing? <br>
                 Or advoiding eyes of judgement?<br><br>
      
                 While writing this, <br>
                 it brought me back to 2019, <br>
                 when, admittily, <br>
                 I unconsciously patronized a homeless man, whose face and hands I remember today. <br>
                 My friend at the time whom walked with me patronized me in return, deservingly. <br>
                 She put my actions in perspective. <br>
                 I ran into him other times, giving him water, or warm cookies I'd bought for myself. <br><br>
      
                 And from that day on I began treating those less fortunate with the upmost respect. <br><br>
          
                  <strong>Perspective changes the way we treat others.</strong><br>

                  but that of their leaders. <br><br>
      
                  As agents, <br>

                  I have a different school of thought for the leaders of the state. <br><br>

          <h2><u>Morality</u></h2>
               <p>I have made conscious efforts to not act on behalf of my own personal interesst,<br> 
                  or that of the interest of others, <br>
                  but have acted on what I felt was right.<br> <br>
      
                  Though I myself am not <em>currently</em> relegious,<br>
                  i've adopted <em>most</em> of the ethical prinicples writen into scipture, <br>
                  and believe Jesus Christ, in his historical depiction, apart from the diety, <br>
                  is the best role model that I could ever have.<br><br>
      
                  What's moral, however, is not universal. <br>
                  It's been debated for since man had rational. <br><br>
      
                  What we belive is shaped by our teachings, experiences, etc, <br>
                  which is different for everyone.<br><br>
      
                  So, even though I have my own ethical standards I try to keep myself accountable to, <br>
                  It is almost certain that my standards are, atleast in some part, flawed, <br>
                  and my behavior in accordance to these principles even more so. <br><br>
      
                  However, this distortion is what I call the inevitable consequence of human nature.<br><br>
                  
                  Even those amoung us past or present that we belive to be enlightened are likley... <br>
                  False prophets.<br><br>
      
                  As Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi illustrated though his poem, <br>
                  the Elephant in the Dark: 
                      <div id="rumi">
                          <h6>
                          Some Hindus have an elephant to show.<br>
                          No one here has ever seen an elephant.<br>
                          They bring it at night to a dark room.<br><br>
      
                          One by one, we go in the dark and come out<br>
                          saying how we experience the animal.<br>
                          One of us happens to touch the trunk.<br>
                          A water-pipe kind of creature.<br><br>
      
                          Another, the ear. A very strong, always moving<br>
                          back and forth, fan-animal. Another, the leg.<br>
                          I find it still, like a column on a temple.<br><br>
      
                          Another touches the curved back.<br>
                          A leathery throne. Another the cleverest,<br>
                          feels the tusk. A rounded sword made of porcelain.<br>
                          He is proud of his description.<br><br>
      
                          Each of us touches one place<br>
                          and understands the whole that way.<br>
                          The palm and the fingers feeling in the dark<br>
                          are how the senses explore the reality of the elephant.<br><br>
      
                          If each of us held a candle there,<br>
                          and if we went in together, we could see it.<br>

          <h2><u>Flourish</u></h2>
           <p>
              To flourish, <br>
              is to be in pursuit of a better you. <br><br>
      
              It is not the achivement of my dreams that matters most to me, <br>
              but the underlying force pushing for progression, <br>
              twords a better version of myself, <br>
              mitigating any friction of what arises inevitably from my human nature, <br>
              to follow my passion with a greater momemtum, <br>
              closer to the limitless potentiol I posses. <br><br>
         
              So if I were to die tomorrow, <br>
              with so many of my goals falling short of obtainment, <br>
              know I held inner peace, <br>
              becuase I have, <br>
              to my own accord, <br>
              reached self-actualzation, <br>
              becuase I have everything that I want today,<br>
              and I am breaking the barries of tomorrow. <br><br>
      
              <strong>I cherish the pursuit of a better me</strong><br>

          <h2><u>Martyr</u></h2>
           <p> Intense emotion I felt, <br>
               driving on an ordinary brisk day of Feburary,<br>
               listening to the reports of militant invasion between two forgien countries, <br>
               located half the distince of the globe away from me. <br><br>
               Sentiment is no stranger to me listening to the news, <br>
               but todays had an unexpected source. <br>
               It was not sympathy for the citizens of the country hosting unwanted conflict, <br>
               or fury at the stubborn leaderships of the superior yet unwarented offensive force, <br>
               but <em>admiration</em> for the warriors defending their oppressed nation <br>
               for on this day, <br>
               soldiers, <br>
               mortal men and women, <br>
               gave the ultimate sacrifice, <br>
               knowing well the dominant yet unfavorable outcome of the engagement, <br>
               to uphold the dignity of themselves, <br>
               and for their country, <br>
               for the world to bear witness. <br><br>

              <p>"What was I hearing" <br>
                  I asked myself with my eyes shut.<br> <br>
                  Sounds of something wooshing... constant undistinguishablee noise from afar flooding my ears.<br>
                  I would of guessed an interstate highway, a mainroad in the distince, where cars and large trucks were traveling hastly. <br><br>
                  Instead, I knew where I was. <br><br>
                  No more than a few hundred feet away from the ocean front I stood; a rock formation coming between us and the sight of crashing waves, thus explaining the supression of sound. <br>
                  I was hearing the raw intensity of mother nature.<br><br>
                  Sadness I felt, thinking how accustomed my ears had become to everything in the world unnatural. <br><br>
                  <strong>My senses, had they become desentized to true beauty?</strong><br>

                  <h2><u>My First Post</u></h2>
                   <p> Anybody who spends time aroud me knows that I spend everyday journaling, <br>
                       keeping my notebook and pencil by my side. <br><br>
  
                       It brings inner peace to me when I journal, <br>
                       as I have too many thoughts <em>(reflections)</em> that I keep within me. <br><br>
  
                       Naturally, as an introvert, <br>
                       I keep the majority of these reflections to myself, <br>
                       though I do wish to share them. <br><br>
  
                       Sharing our deep introspective reflecttions is, afterall, <br>
                       a way we can best flourish with regard to our human nature.<br> <br>
  
                       This creative venture is partly inspired by Marcus Aurelius (Roman Emperorr 161-180), <br>
                       who had written a series of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditationspersonal writings">personal writings.</a><br><br>
