        Unsurprisingly, the Taliban has decided to go back on their word that all girls would be allowed to go to school, as they had been able to for 20 years prior to the Taliban regaining control in afghanistan. <br><br>

        Afterall, it was only 20 years ago since the Taliban previously reigned in Afganistan and barred girls from attending school before, murdering those, including children, who opposed their ideology. <br><br>
        
        However, this time around, they had only banned girls at the 6th grade level and on.<br><br>
        
        There was no cancelation announcement for secondary school girls attempting to attend classes on the scheduled opening day. Instead, they arrived at class, yet were turned away, some with the wave of a hand, others with a wave of a 7.62mm caliber AK-47 assult rifle. <br><br>
        
        The Taliban's ambassador the the United Nations gave a statement regarding that this barring of girls from attending secondary education was only temporary, stating it was only a matter of a uniform issue to be resolved soon. This statement, however, I have no confidence in. An organization whose ranks are filled with a variety of extremists will not follow along with a spokesperson's promises; a puppet who was likely picked and trained to tailor towards western minds. <br><br>
        
        They also allow women to attend Universities; Taliban controlled universities that is. Taliban controlled curriculum, dress code, classroom policies (i.e. segregation of men and women), and Taliban approved instructors. <br><br>
        
        So they have barred girls from receiving a secondary education and make it unbearable for women to go to university. Assuming the requirements for university is having a secondary education, and the barring of girls from attending 6th grade on, it will only be a matter of time till there are no more girls being education past 12 years old. <br><br>

        I would argue the Taliban is strategizing to get what they want while walking on eggshells to not outrage the western world as much as it had done in the past, allowing them to get away with their oppressive methods. <br>

        Thankfully, it appears girls and women still have access to education though books and the internet. <br><br>

        To the girls and women of Afghanistan, do not give up hope. <br><br>
