        It would shock you how particular aspects of your book had manifested themselves into today’s society in 2022. <br><br></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        The heart of your story is Big Brother, and that he is <em>always watching you</em>. Well today, <strong>Big Brother is watching</strong>, and many of us have been submissive to this fact, me included. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        There are cameras and microphones on every street, in every building, in our homes, and we even carry them on us. Our movements are tracked, our conversations have receipts, and our faces video recorded. Constantly! </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        Our reality may be progressively turning into something more horrifying in your story. We <em>don’t care</em> about the truth. We have given up more of our privacy than at any point in history, <em> willingly</em> whether we were conscious of it or not. <br></p>

        Thankfully, other countries are more aligned with the dystopian country of Oceania than the U.S. where I am home to. </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        Russia recently initiated a war with Ukraine over geopolitical disputes. Like Winston in the Ministry of Truth, who had to spread false information, Russia’s government controlled news stations and papers are forbidden from referring to the war as anything but “a special military operation”. If they don’t? A potential 15 year prison sentence for spreading fake news. </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        The Russian President also preached to its citizens that the war is just on account that the “special military operation” is for the “denazification” of Ukraine. Russians including the soldiers are true believers of this, even though the President of Ukraine is, afterall, Jewish and the Ukraine people prideful in their countries leadership (evident from the countless civilians turned combatants laying down their lives in the name of Ukraine).</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        Even when provided with evidence of war and civilian focused attacks, even with Ukarinians calling their Russian families crying out about the war, the Russian people still mistrust the proof, due to the propaganda fed by the Russian controlled news channels.<br></p>
        
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        And this letter is not meant to get political, it is merely a comparison of your horror dystopian fantasy to our reality, or what I perceive as reality. <br></p>
        
        <p style="text-indent: 40px">
        But then again, who knows if I am receiving the accurate information?</p>
