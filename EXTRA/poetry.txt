            <p>
               Out of the trench and over the wall,<br>
               I find myself crawling, clinging my body to the ground as <br>
               sounds of machine guns fire and bullets fly overhead<br>
               along with the bass that is mortor rounds impacting nearby. <br><br>
               
               The vibrations carry through the hands that cling the earth, <br>
               and that of my rifle.<br><br>
               
               The dark night is only illuminated by that of the tracer rounds <br>
               and raw energy derived from explosives and flames. <br><br>
               
               I keep pulling my body foward, only seeing my hands in front of me.<br><br>
               
               My hands, my hands, similar in size and shapes to those who crawl next to me, <br>
               similar to those who fire at me.<br><br>
               
               But Déjà Vu strikes as I look at my hands, <br>
               as it was only a decade ago, where these were hands of just a child.<br><br>
               
               They are the same hands, afterall.<br><br>
               
               It felt like yestrerday.<br><br>
               
               But tonight, these hands move me and save my life, <br><br>
               
               so I can that of anothers tomarrow.

                  In a flash<br>
                  both literally and figuitivly,<br>
                  one whom I called brother,  <br>
                  the type of friend you could spend enternity with<br>
                  lie dead in cold blood. <br><br>
                  
                  I stand there, <br>
                  belived to be untoucnhed,<br>
                  in a trance,<br>
                  as the blood from his wounds flow,<br>
                  flooding the surrounding sidewalk. <br><br>
                  
                  The blood is thick, <br>
                  crystal,<br>
                  reflecting the dim dirty flickering light 
                  of the telephone pole directly above.<br><br>
                  
                  Brother,<br>
                  My brother is bleeding, <br>
                  the life of him now stained in concrete.<br><br>
                  
                  Time ticks,<br>
                  blood leaks, <br>
                  and tears fall of my cheek.<br><br>
                  
                  And with nobody around to hear my cries of help,<br>
                  I stay silent, and fall to my knees, at the feet of brother.<br><br>
                  
                  His face, though, reflects peace. <br>
                  Contemptment.<br>
                  A soft smile resonates from his lips.<br><br>
                  
                  Replaced by the waxing cresent moonlight of January <br>
                  is the dirty street light as it goes out forever,<br>
                  and out is the soul of my brother.<br><br>
                  
                  As the moon illuminates him now,<br>
                  his pool of blood, 
                  branched to the left and right side of his body, <br>

                  And he becomes now, and forever, my guardian angel.<br>

               For but a moment<br><br>

               ...<br><br>

               Flames flared high, <br>
               and hot?<br><br>

               No, my conscience illuminated a mere visual <br>
               what I can only describe as the center of volcano.<br><br>

               Theres a tint to my vision, <br>
               a filter masking all that I see, <br>
               orange,<br>
               analogous with fire.<br><br>
               
               The complexiy of my surroundings, <br>
               synomonus with waves of heats, <br>
               oscillating obsessivly.<br><br>

               I'm woozy.<br><br>

               So as if I were to take a single step,<br>
               offbalance,<br>
               into the dream my mind manifested<br>
               my flesh would surly conflagrate, <br>
               and my soul combust.<br><br>

               ...<br><br>

               But as if a blink of the eye <br>
               could extinguish the world,<br>
               perhaps from a tear, <br>
               this alternae world my mind forged,<br>
               rest. <br><br>

               For but a moment...

                The spronos of the birds, <br>

                The alto of the the coyote pack,<br>
                at the peak of it's howl <br>
                in the distince as I lay at night. <br><br>

                The tenor of the crickets,<br>
                chirping, as I convoy though open fields of straw.<br><br>
                
                The bass of the swamp frogs, <br>
                peeping a constant chord as I see the sun continues to cease.<br><br>

                The percussion of the startled schools of minnows, <br>

            <p>
                Today I witnessed technology, <br>
                that quite literally<br>
                created art. <br><br>

                Today, 
                artifical intelligence can create art <br>
                that will forever be more aesthetically pleasing<br>
                than anything I can create. <br><br>

                But emotion,<br>
                Passion;<br>
                these make art beautiful. <br><br>

                And for that, <br>
                life forever stays nothing less than, <br><br>

                beautiful.

                    Both my internal introspective self and external enviroment had elevated my stress throughout the week,<br>
                    yet at the same time I feel numb. to it all.<br><br>
  
                    9:54PM<br>
                    I am without fatigue mentally or physcially and I am without material conscience; <br>
                    my notebook.<br>
                    I finished the pages of my last hours before. <br><br>
  
                    I drive to buy one, <br>
                    to write my thoughts and become wholly rational again as I. am bothered by something internally. <br>
                    It could be a number of things.<br><br>

                    The ashphalt absorbs my headlights entirley,  <br>
                    illuminating fully only whats in front and dissipating into my peripheral. <br>
                    Behind me is nothing but the absence of light. <br>
                    Dead decrypted leaves, <br>
                    likley fallen months before from the ever-cycling oak trees,<br>
                    blows in front of my traveling path. <br>
  
                    I am in no rush. <br>
                    I could stay here,<br>
                    with my thoughts and simplistic observaions,<br>
                    letting the minunites pass, <br>
                    detached from the complicated reality of everyday life. <br><br>
  
                    I am in the drivers seat eyes foward,<br>
                    though I feel i'm looking at myself from a birds eye view. <br><br>
  
                    An uninvited reflection takes control of the entirety of my consciousness. <br><br>
  
                    I am alive, older yet full of youth, and healthly. <br><br>
  
                    I am still minunites away from home<br>
                    with the paper of my new journal awaiting ink inscription, <br>
                    though I achived what I'd been seeking as I venture into the dead of night on this vacant dimly lit road;<br><br>
  
                    inner peace.<br><br>
  
                    The stress of my life that seems so trival now retreats, <br>
                    though a new batttle inevitably begins tomorrow as I forget this meditation. </p>

                  and be able to be my genine self. <br><br>
  
                  I am reminded of old memories driving around, <br>
                  no matter what part of the state I find myself in. <br><br>
  
                  And nothing brings my joy like seeing a friendly face everywhere I go, <br>
                  whether it be my barista, my classmates, the librian, <br>
                  or the oddly similar philosphical kid I run into on the daily. <br><br>

                  to serve, <br>
                  and uphold all that is good within my community. </p>

              <h2><u>Intellect</u></h2>
              <p> 
                  I belive the most intellectal self does not reside in books, conversations, or the higher education system, <br>
                  but within my own conscious. <br><br>
  
                  To ask myself who, what, why is important, <br>
                  and not only learn, <br>
                  but critically refect on what infomation I recieve. <br><br>
  
                  What concepts, ideas, solutions come to mind? <br><br>
  
                  I belive books, education, and conversations are a great way to stimulate the mind, <br>
                  but reflection is taking these stimulates and asking more from them. <br><br>
  
                  Knowing facts is simmply not enough, nor should it even be valued in a age of techonoly. <br>
                  Hence is why examinations that test factual knowlahe commit a diservice to students. <br><br>
  
                  What a truly intellectual person does is intake infomationm for the sake of solving problems, <br>
                  whether it be for themselves, <br>
                  of for others, if society is lucky enough to have shaped a mind that wishes to truly benefit the public interest. <br><br>
   
                  <strong>Do not just learn, think. <em>Reflect</em></strong><br>

              <p> 
                  Though I, in the past few years, have felt strongly about the pusuit of helping othes day-to-day<br>
                  whilst in the pursut of a greater good,<br>
                  I latley have been feeling as though,<br>
                  at this point in my life atleast,<br>
                  volunteering at any position is not the best means to serve others in my life. <br><br>
      
                  Instead, I have felt a calling to filling my spare time in pursuits such as reading and writing. <br><br>
      
                  Though they may not serve others at this moment, <br>
                  I feel as though I am building a foundation for greater things. <br><br>
      
                  At a age of 22, I feel as though this, above all things, is a necessity to make my lifes impact. <br><br>
      
                  However, this priority is only temporary. <br>
                  I will at some point decide to move focus onto executiing my mission, <br>
                  opposed to builidng up my character and intellect, <br>
                  otherwise the foundation is worthless. <br><br>
      
                  Maybe after twenty-five, fifty, one-hundred books read, <br>
                  after one, three, five years writing, <br>
                  after years of working, traveling to the cornes of the earth, <br>
                  may I have any thoughts remotly worth something twords the world, <br>
                  or words worth sharing to help mankind. <br><br>
      
                  Or shall we hold the belief that anybody can transcend civilization? <br><br>
      
                  Although this may be true, I do not belive it so for me. <br><br>
      
                  I need to educate myself, <br>
                  to a level not achived my most, <br>
                  and use it in the most substantial way, <br>

              <h2><u>Mortality</u></h2>
              <p> It was only days before the first of spring, <br>
                  and the birds, evidently, were livley on this refreshingly warm day.  <br> <br>
      
                  As was we, endervering on a hike atop this hill.  <br> <br>
      
                  We had paid little attention to the beauty that encompassed the journey to the peak,  <br>
                  apart from the relativly flat aspect of the trip,  <br>
                  where eyes were free.  <br>
                  Of course this was due to the rockey hillside which demanded attention whilst climbing, <br>
                  unless one wanted to know the taste of gneiss or granite.  <br> <br>
      
                  But coming to the top,  <br>
                  and finally having the opportunity to bear the fruits of our labor,  <br>
                  I peared off into the distince. <br> <br>
      
                  Miles of tall red oaks,  <br>
                  that appear stiff and lifeless.  <br> <br>
      
                  <em>A sea of death</em> I thought.  <br> <br>
      
                  Though this of course was not true. <br>
                  The oaks, whether or not it was evident,  <br>
                  were alive and well; they would outlive me, afternall.  <br> <br>
      
                  The mortality I hold was reminded to me on the downslope,  <br>
                  watching two vulchers encirle us. They I would certinly would outlive,  <br>
                  though I know they had wished it not so. They were not, could not, expect me to provide for them. <br> <br>
      
                  Maybe it was the elderly dog accompanying us that the scavengers had become keen on.  <br> <br>
      
                  Maybe in a months time,  <br>
                  the sea of death would finish its tide,  <br>
                  and bring about budding, bird songs, and an air of life.  <br> <br>
      
                  <strong>Death brings about life.</strong><br>

              <p>
                 Two left turning lanes approach, <br>
                 only one of which is filled with vechicles;<br>
                 the right one. <br><br>
      
                 The left lane hugged a median. <br>
                 A homeless man stood there,<br>
                 next to an break in traffic, <br>
                 next to spot to which I poitioned my SUV.<br><br>
      
                 I looked at him as I drive up. <br><br>
      
                 His complexion dark, <br>
                 scruffy, <br>
                 bulky,<br>
                 yet he held inviting eyes, <br>
                 that looked not at me but into distince. <br>
                 He looked cold.<br><br>
      
                 His creased cardboard sign with sharpie read <br>
                 "Anything Helps". <br>
                 Most, including the sign weilder, <br>
                 may assume this means monetary help. <br>
                 Though I take it literally, <br>
                 and offer what I can,<br>
                 wheter it be a gronala bar, <br>
                 a bottled water, <br>
                 or a simple hello. <br><br>
      
                 Unsusal for me, <br>
                 I felt complelled to open my wallet.<br>
                 Two bills; <br>
                 One worth a single dollar and another worth twenty. <br><br>
      
                 Pinching the dollar, <br>
                 I'd observed what I obtained earlier in the week for myself, <br>
                 still unsued, unopened, but there if I <em>wanted</em> it. <br>
                 But here, I thought this man may <em>need</em> it as I did just years ago. <br><br>
      
                 Rolling down my window, <br>
                 his those inviting eyes made contact with mine, <br>
                 followed with a contagious smile. <br>
                 The front teeth mising made no difference. <br>
                 I smiled back, with a few words exchanged. <br><br>
      
                 Out my hand reached,<br> 
                 holding a book with a bill I placed in between random pages.<br><br>
                 
                 A new testament, <br>
                 pocket-edition. <br><br>
      
                 His grin widened, <br>
                 his voice pitch raised with excitment. <br>
                 He had told me he had lost his other bible, <br>
                 and that he wished he hadn't as he reads it in his tent at night. <br>
                 He had made reference to Him durning our conversation,<br>
                 pointing above, <br>
                 beliving in the signs He provides. <br><br>
      
                 Moments passed, and I drove away. <br><br>
      
                 I felt a mix of emotions. <br><br>
      
                 Shame, <br>
                 I felt for him, <br>
                 looking though his eyes, <br>
                 at the cars who decided to stay away in the futher lane. <br><br>
      
                 Disipointment, <br>
                 for those in the cars, <br>
                 being less comfortable next to a man in need, <br>
                 than with themelvess for wanting to avoid any interaction, <br>
                 even eye contact.<br>
                 But those in the cars were no different that I just a few years ago.<br><br>
      
                 Joy, <br>
                 which was not derived from the feeling of helping a person in need, <br>
                 but from the reflection of his expresion when I offered him a single bill, <br>
                 along with text of wisdom. <br><br>
      
                 Curiousity, <br>
                 as I questioned myself,<br> 
                 for not giving the man a $20. <br>
                 I did not want to give it to him. <br>
                 But why? <br>
                 Had I thought I needed it more?<br>
                 Had I thought I deserved it more?<br>
                 Had I thought I would spend it better?<br><br>
      
                 And why had he been staring off into the distince? <br>
                 Was he thinking? <br>
                 Dozing? <br>
                 Or advoiding eyes of judgement?<br><br>
      
                 While writing this, <br>
                 it brought me back to 2019, <br>
                 when, admittily, <br>
                 I unconsciously patronized a homeless man, whose face and hands I remember today. <br>
                 My friend at the time whom walked with me patronized me in return, deservingly. <br>
                 She put my actions in perspective. <br>
                 I ran into him other times, giving him water, or warm cookies I'd bought for myself. <br><br>
      
                 And from that day on I began treating those less fortunate with the upmost respect. <br><br>
          
                  <strong>Perspective changes the way we treat others.</strong><br>

              <h2><u>Judgement</u></h2>
              <p>
                  Although soldiers, <br>
                  among any lower agents of the state,<br>
                  may fulfilling a unmoral duty by waging unwarented conflict,<br>
                  or commiting an unjust act, <br>
                  it is the not the conscious of the individual agent to be judged, <br>
                  but that of their leaders. <br><br>
      
                  As agents, <br>
                  it is their role to act on behalf of the state. <br><br>
      
                  As agents, <br>
                  they do not have enough infomation to make the <em>right</em> decisions, <br>
                  but entrust in their informed chain of command to hold this responsbility. <br><br>
      
                  So if acts of the agents,<br>
                  ordered by <em>the state</em>, <br>
                  are to be seen as inhumane or evil, <br>
                  let it not refelct on the leaders.  <br>
      
                  I wish the best for soldiers of both sides of a conflict. <br><br>
      
                  I have a different school of thought for the leaders of the state. <br><br>
      
                  <strong> If you are to judge, judge those truly responsible</strong><br>

          <h2><u>Morality</u></h2>
               <p>I have made conscious efforts to not act on behalf of my own personal interesst,<br> 
                  or that of the interest of others, <br>
                  but have acted on what I felt was right.<br> <br>
      
                  Though I myself am not <em>currently</em> relegious,<br>
                  i've adopted <em>most</em> of the ethical prinicples writen into scipture, <br>
                  and believe Jesus Christ, in his historical depiction, apart from the diety, <br>
                  is the best role model that I could ever have.<br><br>
      
                  What's moral, however, is not universal. <br>
                  It's been debated for since man had rational. <br><br>
      
                  What we belive is shaped by our teachings, experiences, etc, <br>
                  which is different for everyone.<br><br>
      
                  So, even though I have my own ethical standards I try to keep myself accountable to, <br>
                  It is almost certain that my standards are, atleast in some part, flawed, <br>
                  and my behavior in accordance to these principles even more so. <br><br>
      
                  However, this distortion is what I call the inevitable consequence of human nature.<br><br>
                  
                  Even those amoung us past or present that we belive to be enlightened are likley... <br>
                  False prophets.<br><br>
      
                  As Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi illustrated though his poem, <br>
                  the Elephant in the Dark: 
                      <div id="rumi">
                          <h6>
                          Some Hindus have an elephant to show.<br>
                          No one here has ever seen an elephant.<br>
                          They bring it at night to a dark room.<br><br>
      
                          One by one, we go in the dark and come out<br>
                          saying how we experience the animal.<br>
                          One of us happens to touch the trunk.<br>
                          A water-pipe kind of creature.<br><br>
      
                          Another, the ear. A very strong, always moving<br>
                          back and forth, fan-animal. Another, the leg.<br>
                          I find it still, like a column on a temple.<br><br>
      
                          Another touches the curved back.<br>
                          A leathery throne. Another the cleverest,<br>
                          feels the tusk. A rounded sword made of porcelain.<br>
                          He is proud of his description.<br><br>
      
                          Each of us touches one place<br>
                          and understands the whole that way.<br>
                          The palm and the fingers feeling in the dark<br>
                          are how the senses explore the reality of the elephant.<br><br>
      
                          If each of us held a candle there,<br>
                          and if we went in together, we could see it.<br>

           <p>
              To flourish, <br>
              is to be in pursuit of a better you. <br><br>
      
              It is not the achivement of my dreams that matters most to me, <br>
              but the underlying force pushing for progression, <br>
              twords a better version of myself, <br>
              mitigating any friction of what arises inevitably from my human nature, <br>
              to follow my passion with a greater momemtum, <br>
              closer to the limitless potentiol I posses. <br><br>
         
              So if I were to die tomorrow, <br>
              with so many of my goals falling short of obtainment, <br>
              know I held inner peace, <br>
              becuase I have, <br>
              to my own accord, <br>
              reached self-actualzation, <br>
              becuase I have everything that I want today,<br>
              and I am breaking the barries of tomorrow. <br><br>
      
              <strong>I cherish the pursuit of a better me</strong><br>

           <p> Intense emotion I felt, <br>
               driving on an ordinary brisk day of Feburary,<br>
               listening to the reports of militant invasion between two forgien countries, <br>
               located half the distince of the globe away from me. <br><br>
               Sentiment is no stranger to me listening to the news, <br>
               but todays had an unexpected source. <br>
               It was not sympathy for the citizens of the country hosting unwanted conflict, <br>
               or fury at the stubborn leaderships of the superior yet unwarented offensive force, <br>
               but <em>admiration</em> for the warriors defending their oppressed nation <br>
               for on this day, <br>
               soldiers, <br>
               mortal men and women, <br>
               gave the ultimate sacrifice, <br>
               knowing well the dominant yet unfavorable outcome of the engagement, <br>
               to uphold the dignity of themselves, <br>
               and for their country, <br>
               for the world to bear witness. <br><br>

              <p>"What was I hearing" <br>
                  I asked myself with my eyes shut.<br> <br>
                  Sounds of something wooshing... constant undistinguishablee noise from afar flooding my ears.<br>
                  I would of guessed an interstate highway, a mainroad in the distince, where cars and large trucks were traveling hastly. <br><br>
                  Instead, I knew where I was. <br><br>
                  No more than a few hundred feet away from the ocean front I stood; a rock formation coming between us and the sight of crashing waves, thus explaining the supression of sound. <br>
                  I was hearing the raw intensity of mother nature.<br><br>
                  Sadness I felt, thinking how accustomed my ears had become to everything in the world unnatural. <br><br>
