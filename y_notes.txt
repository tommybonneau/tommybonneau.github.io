<h2><u>Hope for Haiti</u></h2>

 <p>


To Whom it May Concern:<br><br>

My understanding of the situation in Haiti is that there lies a humanitarian emergency resulting chiefly from the assassination of the democratically appointed president, <br>
the temporary appointment of the role by a non democratically elected prime minister and therefore a question of legitimacy, <br>
the uprising of control of the country via gangs who have been committing horrendous crimes in order to show power, <br>
the outbreak of a once declared eradicate virus cholera, <br>
and finally a request on behalf of Haiti to the us, the United States of America, to intervene with armed force. <br><br>


I do not question the legitimacy or responsibility of my government to understand the gravity of the situation, <br>
but I do question their inaction. I comprehend the objection to sending United States troops to Haiti durning this time, <br>
for the reasons of not wishing to risk the lives of American troops, <br>
the potential expense of such an intervention, <br>
not not wishing to uphold a current questionable governing authority, <br>
as well as other more hypothetically based speculations I will not dive into. <br><br>

In fact, I am partly on the same page of the leadership of my country in their apparent plan to work with other countries militaries in order to provide armed support,<br>
as the U.S. Military is not a world police force. <br><br>

I believe that armed interventiomn from another country will still hold the same level of force necessary to make a considerable difference in Haiti with mitigated risk to the United States, <br>
and possible other speculative benefits such as incentives to the country that decides to intervene (funding, increased political releations with the U.S. and Haiti, ect).<br><br>

With that being said, what the United States can do, <br>
is send a handful of United States subject matter experts in the fields relevant to the situation. <br><br>

Not only does the United States hold an enormous amount of military and security related resources, <br>
we also hold an arsenal of brilliant and pragmatic professionals whom would likely pounce at an opportunity to help the thousands of people driven out of their homes over the last few months, <br>
stop the rapping and killing of thousands more including children, <br>
and end the cholera outbreak. <br><br>

Our experts will be able to truly seek what it is that Haiti needs, <br>
and understand the means to achive the solution pragmnatially.<br><br>

No, Haiti is not our country or curicial ally,<br>
and what happens to be occurring there is not necessarily in the interest of our own national security excluding the increasing migration of Haitians into the United States, <br>
however, it is in the interest in the best version of all of us around the world to do what we reasonably as it is not within rational and moral means to turn a blind eye or wholly put the request of support on a less capable entity. <br><br>

No solution will be immediate and complete, <br>
however, what action on behalf of the United States will provide, even if it is in a non-armed means, is hope to the Haitian people. <br><br>

Hope that families do not have to decide whether between taking their child to seek medical care for cholera or stay home so they do not risk taking fire from the gangs that control the streets. <br><br>

Hope that their homes will not be intruded and they themselves not raped and killed. <br><br>

Hope that action is being taken to help their country, and not having to accept that this is the new way of life. <br>
