<h2><u>Connection</u></h2>

 <p>


It hasn’t been until recently months, <br>

When I find myself continuously in the same routine that I’d followed for the last few years, <br>

That I have felt a deep rooted sense of discomfort. <br><br>


To be be walking in the same shoes that I’d walked in for years, <br>

with safety and stability,<br>

only to be suddenly caught off guard by disconnect from what previously served as the foundation of my life?<br><br>


It has been messing with my inner peace.<br><br>


What’s alleviated this growing feeling of dissociation of what I believe to be the great adventure of life has been escaping into other worlds:<br>

The natural world,<br>

one of my own consciousness, <br>

and the authentic perspective of others who can see the world in such a different and beautiful way that I do. <br><br>


Worlds that I will forever be able to explore and learn form, <br>

worlds that provide truth, <br>

so the adventure of life never ends, <br>

and all that is required is a connection.<br><br>
