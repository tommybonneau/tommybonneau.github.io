<h2><u>With Regards to the Russian Prisoner Swap</u></h2>

 <p>


As much turmoil as there is with regards to allowing Brittany Griner, <br>
a WNBA caught in a small possession of THC oil, <br>
being the one freed from Russian imprisonment through the Prisoner Exchange swap over Paul Whalen, <br>
an American Patriot, <br>
I have decided that this was an appropriate move on behalf of the United States. <br><br>

At the end of the day, <br>
the offense of Griner compared to Whalen couldn’t be further apart. <br>
One charge was the possession of a small amount of THC oil, <br>
for personal use, <br>
and widely accepted as a recreational drug in the west. <br>
The other charge was espionage, <br>
with possible implications ranging to a national security threat to Russia. <br><br>

Given the fact that both individuals were given a fair and impartial trial, <br>
and that the truth of the matter is that both Americans were caught committing a crime, <br>
it is without doubt that I believe Brittany should have been given precedent regardless of her previous feelings or remarks demeaning our country. <br><br>

Yes, <br>
it would have been far better for the U.S. to get a 2 for 1 deal, <br>
especially considering the gravity of the crimes U.S. held Russian prisoner, <br>
Viktor Bout, A.K.A. the merchant of death had against him.<br><br>

For context:<br>
"Viktor Bout, in my eyes, is one of the most dangerous men on the face of the Earth," <br>
Michael Braun, the former chief of operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, told "60 Minutes" in 2010.<br><br>

Now on one hand, <br>
it makes sense on behalf of the U.S. to negotiate for both Russian imprisoned U.S. citizens, <br>
and on the other hand it makes sense for Russia to only accept a 1 for 1 trade. <br><br>

However, <br>
who has the true negotiating power here? <br><br>

Russia. <br><br>

Can you hear the cries by millions in Russia for the return of the Merchant of Death like you can for Brittany? <br><br>

Is every celebrity in Russia talking about the unfair imprisonment of Viktor Bout like U.S. celebrities are for Griner (an exaggeration but you can’t escape this sympathy for Griner on U.S. social media)? <br><br>

Does Bout’s imprisonment headline national news week after week since his imprisonment like Griner does here in the U.S.? <br><br>

No, <br>
no, <br>
no. <br><br>

There was an incredible amount of pressure on the President to bring Griner home, <br>
who is seen as a victim of having to serve a severe 9 year imprisonment overseas for what would be considered only a misdemeanor in the U.S. <br><br>

It is unmistakable to realize Griner’s return is a priority to the U.S., <br>
and although many Americans are outraged that she gets to come home and Whalen has to stay, <br>
a majority of people would be even more outraged to see the opposite; Griner stays and Whalen comes home… <br>
or even worse… <br>
to find out Biden had an opportunity to bring Griner home but didn’t. <br><br>

Take the perspective of Russia… <br>
they bring more to the table for negotiating then the U.S., <br>
they have more power in this negotiation.<br><br>

It’s obvious we were not going to get a 2 for 1.<br><br>

We took what we could,<br>
all considered. <br><br>

Paul, by sacrificing your own freedom for that of Brittanys’ whether it was your decision to or not, <br>
you are still serving and protecting American Citizens. <br><br>

I salute you.
