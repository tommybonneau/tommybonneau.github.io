<h2><u>With Regards to the RING Activation</u></h2>

 <p>

Governor, <br><br>

As a representative of the National Guard, 
I am extremely thankful for the opportunity to be activated in order to support the populations of this state so vulnerable at this time. <br><br>

I joined the Rhode Island National Guard to serve my state and country in times of need, 
at points when our state or country needs somebody to step up. <br><br>

During COVID, 
while everyone had to stay home during the initial lockdowns, 
I was tankful to be able to respond to the emergency that was the first waves of the pandemic. <br><br>

With no doubt that our military capabilities are like none other in the world,
given the yearly budget both in a actual dollar amount and percent GDP, 
it is good to see that funding go to use and allow the soldiers who joined for a good cause be able to live by what they believed in when they joined; helping those in need. <br><br>

It saddens me to see the homeless population continue to struggle despite all that has become available to them over the years, but an imperfect state leaves individuals in a situation we hope to not find ourselves; without a home in the elements. <br><br>

Even with all of the organizations, programs, and funding available to combat homelessness, there still go individuals who slip though the cracks given circumstances like they are registered sex offfenders, have a record of arson, face mental health, addiction, or are effected by urban or rural poverty more than others.<br><br>

These populations need more, and again, I am endlessly grateful to be able to serve my state and those in need. <br><br>

Thank you again, 
and please continue to recognize that you have a militia of willing men and women, 
ready and eager to help in times of need. <br><br>

I say this as it was just a few weeks ago during elections that your opponent had suggested a solution to a problem you failed to see. <br><br>

RIPTA, a means of public transportation utilized by thousands, especially socio-economically marginalized communities, was found to be short staffed, effectivly leaving people without essential transportation. The focus of this problem's results was children not having transportation to school. <br><br>

Massachuttes just a year ago activated its national guard to drive buses, given the significant shortage of needed school bus drivers. This, as far as I know, proved effective and thus when the problem of children going without proper transportation to school, your political opponent called for you to act and activate the national guard. <br><br>

Your failure to do so had left me wondering if you refused to do so for reasons far better than activating us soldiers, or if you refused to accept your opponents proposition as it would not be favorable for you during election month. <br><br>

But by your activation of the National Guard in this circumstance, <br><br>
I have more faith in your ability to lead. <br><br>

Thank you.
