    <br>
    <p>A mortal man above anything else, <br>
        but a man who aspires to be the best version of himself <br>
        so I may best serve my guiding principle, the common good. <br><br>
        To be the loving person <br>
        that those in my life deserve. <br><br>
        To be a civic servant, <br>
        where my purpose is to benefit my community, <br>
        and my obligation to do the right thing. <br><br>
        To be apart of organizations, <br>
        that exist to uplift a community and it's members<br>
        in a way a samaritan should extends a hand to their neighbor in need. <br><br>
        An agent of the state and nation I will continue to be, <br>
        though my military service, <br>
        to defend the Constitution of the United States, <br>
        and support my Country when called upon. <br><br>
        To be a life-long scholar, <br>
        and a renassiance man, <br>
        in an effort to master my human nature,<br>
        up until my death. <br><br>
        And finally, <br>
        to write, <br>
        so my thoughts and ideas may live on indefinently. <br><br><br>
